- question:
    I'm encountering audio and video problems while developing a live video
    solution for my app. I'm using Chrome to test the microphone and camera.
    What could be causing this?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: The issue could be due to the security features implemented by the
    browser. Most of the standard browsers with best security practices restrict
    many features to HTTPS instead of HTTP. You can read about the details of
    the features that are restricted in Chrome
    [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins).


    To troubleshoot, we recommend trying the steps mentioned in this
    [document](https://web.dev/how-to-use-local-https/). If this does not
    resolve the issue, you can try using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) as an
    alternative solution.


    To use ngrok, download the software and run it with the local port
    specified. This generates an HTTPS URL that you can use for testing the
    microphone and camera.

    1. Download ngrok.

    2. Run the command 'ngrok http PUT_LOCAL_PORT_HERE'.

    3. Use the HTTPS URL to test your microphone and camera.
