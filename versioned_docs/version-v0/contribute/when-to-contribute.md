Our docs are a continuous work in progress. You're welcome to contribute to the documentation to help improve it, and we want to make it possible for you to become a contributor. You also have the option to provide feedback if you're not ready to contribute.

## Contribute

As a contributor, you'll need to understand the different ways to contribute and the best method based on your changes.

**Does the topic or document exist?**

- If YES, update the doc! Contribute to your heart's content. But first, determine which use case best fits your update:

  - **[Minor changes: (use case #1)](edit-content-minor-changes.md)** If you only need to fix a typo or clarify a sentence or section, this option is your ideal choice. However, in this use case, you cannot upload files, such as an image, and you can update only one file.

  - **[Significant changes: (use case #2)](edit-content-significant-changes.md)** Suppose you must make substantial changes, such as adding an image or editing multiple topics. In that case, this method is your best friend, as you'll have one pull request to manage. Consult with the Sr. Technical Writer first before making changes.

- If NO, should it? If so, consider **[adding it (use case #3)](add-new-topic.md)**, but don't add a topic or doc just because you can. Consult with the Sr. Technical Writer first before adding. For example, your new topic could be added to an existing one, consolidating and clarifying the information. It's also possible that someone else is working on a similar topic. 

- If you're **not comfortable using GitHub or VS Code or don't have access to GitHub (use case #4)**, you can provide the Sr. Technical Writer a document (Google Docs, Microsoft Word, text file, or Confluence page). The Technical Writer can convert the document to markdown. So don't fret! We'll get your content published.


## Provide us feedback 

If you're not ready to contribute, you can provide us **feedback (use case #5)**. Your feedback is essential in shaping the customer content experience. The team will track these ideas and issues to address your feedback. There are several ways to provide feedback:

- **[Submit an enhancement idea][enhancements]** to make the docs better

- **[Open a GitHub issue][issues]** to report a problem with the content (something is incorrect or confusing)
