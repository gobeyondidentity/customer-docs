# Contributor's guide

We've built the Beyond Identity documentation with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), a static-site generator. The source code lives in the [Dev Docs GitHub repo][repo].

You are welcome to contribute to the Beyond Identity developer documentation to help make it better! We want to make it possible for you to become a contributor. Anyone can open an issue about documentation or suggest a change with a [pull request (PR)][pr] to the [GitHub repository][repo]. 

This topic outlines the different ways that you can get involved. In addition, it provides some of the resources that are available to help you get started. All feedback is welcome.

This guide will help you start contributing to Beyond Identity developer documentation! Thank you for taking an interest in contributing. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

### Getting Started

- Before starting your work, ensure an [issue][issues] exists. If not, feel free to create one. 
- Add a comment on the issue and wait for it to be assigned before you start working on it. This helps to avoid multiple people working on similar issues.
- If the solution is complex, propose it and wait for one of the core contributors to approve it before implementing it. This helps in shorter turnaround times in merging PRs.
- For new feature requests, Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Again, real-life business use cases will be super helpful.

## Local Git Repository

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com) (the below instructions assume you are using the CLI, though [GUI clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) will also work!)
- Code editor ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is recommended)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

### Cloning the Repository

You will first need to [clone][repo] the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gobeyondidentity/developer-docs.git
```

This will create a directory named `developer-docs` in your current working directory.

Next, create a new [branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) from `main` (always give your branch a meaningful, descriptive name). 

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name> main
```

### Starting the Development Server

We're finally able to get to the fun stuff! Install the dependencies and start a local development server:

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

The `http://localhost:3000` opens in your browser so you can see your changes reflected live.

### Push your changes

When you are ready to submit your changes for review, commit them to your local repository:

``` bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m
```

Then, push them to your fork:

```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```

You can now [submit your pull request on GitHub][pr]! You are welcome to [open your pull request as a draft](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) for early feedback and review. Be sure to follow the pull request template!

### Keeping Your Branch Up-to-Date

If there are new commits to the `main` branch of the repository, you can update it by pulling from the 'main' remote:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

## Submit a Pull Request 

All code in Beyond Identity aligns with the established [licensing and copyright notice guidelines](https://github.com/Beyond Identity/zlc/blob/master/process/LicenseAndCopyrightGuidance.md).

Before submitting a Pull Request, review the general Beyond Identity [Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/Beyond Identity/community#pull-request-guidelines) and make sure that you provide the information that is required in the Pull Request template in that specific repo. 

All Beyond Identity commits need to be signed by using the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/), which is the same mechanism that the LinuxÂ® Kernel and many other communities use to manage code contributions. You need to add a `Signed-off-by` line as a part of the commit message. Here is an example `Signed-off-by` line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

```Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@hisdomain.com>```

You can find more information about DCO signoff in the [zlc repo](https://github.com/Beyond Identity/zlc/edit/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

## Report security issues

Please direct all security issues to `Beyond Identity-security@lists.openmainframeproject.org`. A member of the security team will reply to acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability and coordinate remediation with the affected project.
