## Documentation style guide <a name="style"></a>

This section gives writing style guidelines for the Beyond Identity documentation.

### Headings and titles<a name="headings"></a>

#### Use sentence-style capitalization for headings

Capitalize only the initial letter of the first word in the text and other words that require capitalization, such as proper nouns. Examples of proper nouns include the names of specific people, places, companies, languages, protocols, and products.

Example: Verifying that your system meets the software requirements.

#### For tasks and procedures, use gerunds for headings.

Example:

- Building an API response
- Setting the active build configuration

#### For conceptual and reference information, use noun phrases for headings.

Example:

- Query language
- Platform and application integration

#### Use headline-style capitalization for only these items:

Titles of books, CDs, videos, and stand-alone information units.

Example:

- Installation and User's Guide
- Quick Start Guides or discrete sets of product documentation

### Technical elements<a name="ui"></a>

#### Variables

Style:

- Italic when used outside of code examples,

    Example: _myHost_

- If wrap using angle brackets `<>` within code examples, italic font is not supported.

    Example:
    - put &lt;pax-file-name&gt;.pax

    - Where _pax-file-name_ is a variable that indicates the full name of the PAX file you download. For example, zoe-0.8.1.pax.

#### Message text and prompts to the user

Style: Put messages in quotation marks.

Example: "The file does not exist."

#### Code and code examples

Style: Monospace

Example: `java -version`

#### Command names, and names of macros, programs, and utilities that you can type as commands

Style: Monospace

Example: Use the `BROWSE` command.

#### Interface controls

Categories: check boxes, containers, fields, folders, icons, items inside list boxes, labels (such as **Note:**), links, list boxes, menu choices, menu names, multicolumn lists, property sheets, push buttons, radio buttons, spin buttons, and Tabs

Style: Bold

Example: From the **Language** menu, click the language that you want to use. The default selection is **English**.

#### Directory names

Style: Monospace

Example: Move the `install.exe` file into the `newuser` directory.

#### File names, file extensions, and script names

Style: Monospace

Example:

- Run the `install.exe` file.
- Extract all the data from the `.zip` file.

#### Search or query terms

Style: Monospace

Example: In the Search field, enter `Beyond Identity`.

#### Citations that are not links

Categories: Chapter titles and section titles, entries within a blog, references to industry standards, and topic titles in IBM Knowledge Center

Style: Double quotation marks

Example:
- See the "Measuring the true performance of a cloud" entry in the blog.
- For installation information, see "Installing the product".

### Tone<a name="tone"></a>

#### Use simple present tense rather than future or past tense, as much as possible.

Example:

:heavy_check_mark: The API returns a promise.

:x: The API will return a promise.

#### Use simple past tense if past tense is needed.

Example:

:heavy_check_mark: The limit was exceeded.

:x: The limit has been exceeded.

#### Use active voice as much as possible

Example:

:heavy_check_mark: In the Limits window, specify the minimum and maximum values.

:x: The Limits window is used to specify the minimum and maximum values.

Exceptions: Passive voice is acceptable when any of these conditions are true:

- The system performs the action.
- It is more appropriate to focus on the receiver of the action.
- You want to avoid blaming the user for an error, such as in an error message.
- The information is clearer in passive voice.

    Example:

    :heavy_check_mark: The file was deleted.

    :x: You deleted the file.

#### Using second person such as "you" instead of first person such as "we" and "our".

In most cases, use second person ("you") to speak directly to the reader.

#### End sentences with prepositions selectively

Use a preposition at the end of a sentence to avoid an awkward or stilted construction.

Example:

:heavy_check_mark: Click the item that you want to search for.

:x: Click the item for which you want to search.

#### Avoid anthropomorphism

Focus technical information on users and their actions, not on a product and its actions.

Example:

:heavy_check_mark: User focus: On the Replicator page, you can synchronize your local database with replica databases.

:x: Product focus: The Replicator page lets you synchronize your local database with replica databases.

#### Avoid complex sentences that overuse punctuation such as commas and semicolons.

### Word usage<a name="word"></a>

#### Note headings such as Note, Important, and Tip should be formatted using the lower case and bold format.

Example:
- **Note:**
- **Important!**
- **Tip:**

#### Use of "following"

For whatever list or steps we are introducing, the word "following" should precede a noun.

Example:
- Before a procedure, use "Follow these steps:"
- The <component_name> supports the following use cases:
- Before you install Beyond Identity, review the following prerequisite installation tasks:

Avoid ending the sentence with "following".

Example:

:x: Complete the following.

:heavy_check_mark: Complete the following tasks.

#### Use a consistent style for referring to version numbers.

When talking about a specific version, capitalize the first letter of Version.

Example:

:heavy_check_mark: Java Version 8.1 or Java V8.1

:x: Java version 8.1, Java 8.1, or Java v8.1


When just talking about version, use "version" in lower case.

Example: Use the latest version of Java.

#### Avoid "may"

Use "can" to indicate ability, or use "might" to indicate possibility.

Example:

- Indicating ability:

    :heavy_check_mark: You can use the command line interface to update your application."

    :x: "You may use the command line interface to update your application."

- Indicating possibility:

    :heavy_check_mark: "You might need more advanced features when you are integrating with another application. "

    :x:  "You may need more advanced features when you are integrating with another application."

#### Use "issue" when you want to say "run/enter" a command.

Example: At a command prompt, issue the following command:

### Abbreviations<a name="abbreviations"></a>

#### Do not use an abbreviation as a noun unless the sentence makes sense when you substitute the spelled-out form of the term.

Example:

:x: The tutorials are available as PDFs. [portable document formats]

:heavy_check_mark: The tutorials are available as PDF files.

#### Do not use abbreviations as verbs.

Example:

:x: You can FTP the files to the server.

:heavy_check_mark: You can use the FTP command to send the files to the server.

#### Do not use Latin abbreviations.

Use their English equivalents instead. Latin abbreviations are sometimes misunderstood.

Latin  | English equivalent
---|---
e.g.  | for example
etc. | and so on. <br/> When you list a clear sequence of elements such as "1, 2, 3, and so on" and "Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and so on." Otherwise, rewrite the sentence to replace "etc." with something more descriptive such as "and other output."
i.e.  | that is

#### Spell out the full name and its abbreviation when the word appears for the first time. Use abbreviations in the texts that follow.

Example: Mainframe Virtual Desktop (MVD)

### Structure and format<a name="Structure"></a>

Add "More information" to link to useful resources or related topics at the end of topics where necessary.

### Word usage<a name="usage"></a>

The following table alphabetically lists the common used words and their usage guidelines.

Do  | Don't
---|---
application  | app
Capitalize "Server" when it's part of the product name |
Java  |  java
IBM z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) <br/> z/OSMF   | zosmf (unless used in syntax)
ID| id
PAX| pax

## Submit a Pull Request 

All code in Beyond Identity aligns with the established [licensing and copyright notice guidelines](https://github.com/Beyond Identity/zlc/blob/master/process/LicenseAndCopyrightGuidance.md).

Before submitting a Pull Request, review the general Beyond Identity [Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/Beyond Identity/community#pull-request-guidelines) and make sure that you provide the information that is required in the Pull Request template in that specific repo. 

All Beyond Identity commits need to be signed by using the [Developer’s Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/), which is the same mechanism that the Linux® Kernel and many other communities use to manage code contributions.
