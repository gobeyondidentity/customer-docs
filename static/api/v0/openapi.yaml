    ## Introduction

    The Beyond Identity Secure Workforce Admin API defines methods for administrative duties for your Beyond Identity tenant.<br /><br />

    This API is currently in the early-access stage with limited endpoints implemented. We encourage feedback and suggestions through [support@beyondidentity.com](mailto:support@beyondidentity.com).

    ## Authentication

    All Beyond Identity API endpoints require authentication using an access token. The access token is generated through OAuth 2.0, using the client credentials flow. Follow these steps:

    1. Navigate to the Beyond Identity Secure Workforce Admin Console.
    2. Under the **Settings** tab in the side panel, select the **API Access** tab and create a set of client credentials.
    3. Use the client ID and client secret to exchange the client credentials for an access token. You can use the following cURL call below:

    ```
    curl https://api.byndid.com/v2/oauth2/token \
      -X POST \
      -u "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" --basic \
      -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
      -d "grant_type=client_credentials"
    ```

    Alternatively, an access token may also be generated via the Admin Console.

    1. Navigate to the Beyond Identity Secure Workforce Admin Console.
    2. Under the **Settings** tab in the side panel, select the **API Access** tab and create a set of client credentials.
    3. Next, select the created client credentials, navigate to the **Tokens** tab, and click **Create token**.

    Once you've obtained the access token, you must provide it in the `Authorization` header  of any API request.

    ```
    curl https://api.byndid.com/v2/... \
      -X $HTTP_METHOD -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
    ```
    ## Rate Limiting

    The Beyond Identity public API is subject to rate limiting to ensure a consistent quality of service for our customers. Rate limits are enforced per tenant, if you are experiencing
    issues with the default rate limits provided, please refer to our [support page](https://support.beyondidentity.com/hc/en-us/articles/15689103572759-SCIM-Rate-Limits).

    When a request exceeds a rate limit, our application server returns an HTTP 429 status code and RateLimit-* headers, as described in RateLimit Header Fields for HTTP. Example response:
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
    RateLimit-Limit: 30
    RateLimit-Remaining: 0
    RateLimit-Reset: 7
    ```
    ## Authorization

    Each method will have associated scopes. See the `Authorizations` portion within each method to see the scopes.<br /><br />

    The access token used must contain all scopes for the method to be able to access the endpoint.

    ## Requests and Responses

    When interacting with the Beyond Identity Secure Workforce Admin API, all requests must be made over HTTPS.

    The Beyond Identity API is structured as a resource-oriented API.    Resources are represented as JSON objects and are used as both inputs to and outputs from API methods.

    Resource fields can be read-only and immutable. For example, system-generated IDs are both read-only and immutable.

    - A **read-only** field is provided only in the response.
    - An **immutable** field is assigned only once and cannot be changed.

    <br />

    ### Create a new resource

    Create requests use the `POST` method and include the necessary attributes to create a new resource. Create operations return the created resource in the response.<br /><br />

    ### Retrieve resources

    Retrieve requests use the `GET` method. You can retrieve a single resource or a collection of resources. When retrieving a collection of resources, the response includes an array of JSON objects keyed on the plural name of the requested resource.<br /><br />

    ### Update resources

    Update requests use the `PATCH` method. Update operations support partial updating, so you can specify only the attributes you want to update. Update operations return the updated resource in the response.<br /><br />

    ### Delete resources

    Delete requests use the `DELETE` method, which returns an empty response instead of returning the resource in the response.<br /><br />

    ### Example response for a user

    ```
    {
      "id": "b60a8085-2508-46d8-8ef6-aba593afaac2",
      "tenant_id": "acme-corp",
      "username": "alice.acmecorp"
      "display_name": "Alice Acmecorp",
      "create_time": "2022-06-22T21:46:08.930278Z",
      "update_time": "2022-06-22T21:46:08.930278Z",
      ...
    }
    ```
    <br />

    ### Example response for a collection of users

    ```
    {
      "users": [
        {
          "id": "b60a8085-2508-46d8-8ef6-aba593afaac2",
          "tenant_id": "acme-corp",
          "username": "alice.acmecorp"
          "display_name": "Alice Acmecorp",
          "create_time": "2022-06-22T21:46:08.930278Z",
          "update_time": "2022-06-22T21:46:08.930278Z",
          ...
        }
      ],
      "total_size": 1
    }
    ```



    ## HTTP statuses

    The API returns standard HTTP statuses and error codes.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Code range</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>200</td>
        <td>The request was fulfilled successfully with no errors.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>400</td>
        <td>There was an issue with the request that the client may address. For example, client errors may indicate that the request was missing proper authorization or was malformed.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="border-bottom">
        <td>500</td>
        <td>The server encountered an internal issue and could not fulfill the request.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    All error responses include a JSON object with a `code` field and a `message` field.

    - `code` has a human-readable name for the HTTP status code, and
    - `message` has a high-level description of the error.

    The error can also have additional details that the client can use to determine the exact cause of the
    error. Refer to each API method's examples to determine the specific error detail types supported for that method.<br /><br />

    ### Invalid access token example

    If the provided access token is invalid, you will receive a **401** error.
    This error indicates that the token is not recognized or was not generated
    by Beyond Identity.

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    {
      "code": "unauthorized",
      "message": "unauthorized"
    }
    ```
    <br />

    ### Permission denied example

    If the provided access token does not have access to the requested resource,
    you will receive a **403** error. Access tokens are scoped at a minimum to your
    tenant. Any request for resources outside of your tenant will result in this
    error.

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
    {
      "code": "forbidden",
      "message": "forbidden"
    }
    ```
    <br />

    ### Missing resource example

    If the requested resource does not exist, you'll receive a **404** error. The
    specific API method may return additional details about the missing
    resource.

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    {
      "code": "not_found",
      "message": "user not found"
      "details": [
        {
          "type": "ResourceInfo",
          "resource_type": "User",
          "id": "348afd29-f265-4eee-9451-1fcf71832e77",
          "description": "user not found"
        }
      ],
    }
    ```
    <br />

    ### Invalid parameters example

    If the request body contains invalid parameters, you'll receive a **400**
    error. The specific API method may return additional details about the
    invalid parameter.

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    {
      "code": "bad_request",
      "message": "invalid parameters"
      "details": [
        {
          "type": "FieldViolations"
          "field_violations": [
            {
              "description": "missing",
              "field": "user.display_name"
            }
          ],
        }
      ],
    }
    ```
    <br />

    ### Too many requests example

    If the caller has exceeded their rate limit they may receive a **429**
    error. When receiving a 429 response, clients should use the rate limit
    headers to determine when to retry their request. The response includes
    the following headers:

    - `RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed in the current time window
    - `RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current window
    - `RateLimit-Reset`: The number of seconds until the rate limit window resets

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
    RateLimit-Limit: 1
    RateLimit-Remaining: 0
    RateLimit-Reset: 30
    ```

    Clients should wait until the rate limit window resets (indicated by
    `RateLimit-Reset`) before retrying their request. The rate limit headers
    follow the [IETF draft specification](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers-02.html)

    ## SCIM vs. Native APIs

    Beyond Identity provides two sets of APIs for managing users and groups: SCIM APIs and native Directory APIs. Understanding when to use each API set is important for successful integration:

    ### SCIM APIs (/scim/v2/*)
    - Use SCIM APIs primarily for synchronizing users and groups from your identity provider (IdP) into Beyond Identity's directory
    - Important: Objects must be created through SCIM to be manageable via SCIM APIs
    - Best suited for automated user provisioning and deprovisioning workflows
    - Follows the [SCIM 2.0 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643) ([RFC7643](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643) and [RFC7644](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644)) for standardized identity management

    ### Native Directory APIs (/v2/*)
    - Use these APIs for audit, observability, and administrative operations
    - Provides more detailed control and visibility into Beyond Identity-specific features
    - Best suited for building custom integrations and automation workflows
    - Recommended for retrieving user and group information for reporting or monitoring purposes

    Choose SCIM APIs when integrating with identity providers and automated provisioning systems. Use native Directory APIs when building custom applications or requiring detailed audit and administrative capabilities.

        request body for read-only attributes get ignored.

        If the requested group name is already in use, you'll receive a 409 error.

        Note that this endpoint does not support creating permission groups. If the
        request attempts to create a group with the name of a permission group, you
        will receive a 403 error.

      operationId: ListGroups
      summary: List all groups for a tenant
      description: |
        To list all groups for a tenant, send a GET request to `/v2/groups`. Note
        that this endpoint excludes permission groups.

        The response will have up to 1000 items. The response will be empty if the
        page size is not specified (i.e., the default). By default, the list is in
        ascending order by `create_time`. The maximum and default page sizes are
        subject to change.

        When paginating, use the `skip` parameter as the offset.

        When filtering, the response will only show users that satisfy this filter.
        The syntax follows the SCIM grammar from
        [RFC7644 Section 3.4.2.2](https:datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2).

        The supported operations are:
          - eq (equals)
          - ne (not equals)
          - co (contains)
          - sw (starts with)
          - ew (ends with)

        The supported fields and their supported operations are:
          - id (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - name (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - description (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - source (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)

        When sorting, use the `order_by` parameter. It's a comma-delimited list of
        attributes. Currently, the following fields are supported:

          - name
          - source

        The default sorting order per attribute is ascending. Therefore, if you
        want descending order, append the " desc" suffix to the attribute name.

              - `groups` is set to an array of group objects containing standard
                group attributes.
              - `total_size` is set to the total number of items matched by the
                list request.
            If more items are to be returned by the requested query, make another request using the `skip` query parameter.

      description: |
        To list all users belonging to a group, send a GET request to
        `/v2/groups/$GROUP_ID:listUsers`.

        The response will have up to 1000 items. The response will be empty if the
        page size is not specified (i.e., the default). By default, the list is in
        ascending order by `create_time`. The maximum and default page sizes are
        subject to change.

        When paginating, use the `skip` parameter as the offset.

        When filtering, the response will only show users that satisfy this filter.
        The syntax follows the SCIM grammar from
        [RFC7644 Section 3.4.2.2](https:datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2).

        The supported operations are:
          - pr (present)
          - eq (equals)
          - ne (not equals)
          - co (contains)
          - sw (starts with)
          - ew (ends with)
          - gt (greater than)
          - lt (less than)
          - ge (greater than or equal to)
          - le (less than or equal to)

        The supported fields and their supported operations are:
          - id (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - email_address (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - external_id (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - username (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - display_name (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - state (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - source (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - last_auth_time (pr, eq, ne, gt, lt, ge, le)
          - has_active_passkey (eq, ne)

        When sorting, use the `order_by` parameter. It's a comma-delimited list of
        attributes. Currently, the following fields are supported:

          - display_name
          - username
          - email_address
          - status
          - source
          - last_auth_time

        The default sorting order per attribute is ascending. Therefore, if you
        want descending order, append the " desc" suffix to the attribute name.

      operationId: ListUsers
      summary: List all users for a tenant
      description: |
        To list all users for a tenant, send a GET request to `/v2/users`.

        The response will have up to 1000 items. The response will be empty if the
        page size is not specified (i.e., the default). By default, the list is in
        ascending order by `create_time`. The maximum and default page sizes are
        subject to change.

        When paginating, use the `skip` parameter as the offset.

        When filtering, the response will only show users that satisfy this filter.
        The syntax follows the SCIM grammar from
        [RFC7644 Section 3.4.2.2](https:datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2).

        The supported operations are:
          - pr (present)
          - eq (equals)
          - ne (not equals)
          - co (contains)
          - sw (starts with)
          - ew (ends with)
          - gt (greater than)
          - lt (less than)
          - ge (greater than or equal to)
          - le (less than or equal to)

        The supported fields and their supported operations are:
          - id (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - email_address (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - external_id (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - username (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - display_name (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - state (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - source (eq, ne, co, sw, ew)
          - last_auth_time (pr, eq, ne, gt, lt, ge, le)
          - has_active_passkey (eq, ne)

        When sorting, use the `order_by` parameter. It's a comma-delimited list of
        attributes. Currently, the following fields are supported:

          - display_name
          - username
          - email_address
          - status
          - source
          - last_auth_time

        The default sorting order per attribute is ascending. Therefore, if you
        want descending order, append the " desc" suffix to the attribute name.

      summary: Patch a User
      description: |
        To update only specific attributes of an existing user, send a PATCH
        request to `/Users/$USER_ID`. The PATCH operation is defined by 
        [RFC-7644 §3.5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.5.2).

        The request body MUST contain a valid SCIM PATCH request with a
        "schemas" value of "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp" and
        an "Operations" array with one or more PATCH operations.

        Values in the request body for immutable or read-only fields (as defined in 
        [RFC-7643 §4.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-4.1))
        will be ignored. Fields that are omitted from the request body will be left unchanged.

        Important implementation notes:
        - The Beyond Identity SCIM server currently does not support atomic PATCH operations
        - The server supports two types of PATCH operations:
          1. Email Update: Must use "add" operation with path "emails" and value containing the email object
             (see "Update Email" example)
          2. Generic Update: A path which isn't equal to "emails" is ignored and the value must be a JSON object
             representing the user resource
        - If a request contains multiple operations, the request may be partially applied:
          1. The server first validates the overall request schema and attribute types
          2. Operations are then applied sequentially in the order provided
          3. If any operation fails, processing stops immediately
          4. Previously successful operations remain applied
          5. The error response does not indicate which operation failed or which operations were applied
          6. To determine the current state, clients should issue a GET request after receiving an error

        Important notes about email handling:
        - Only one email address is supported per user
        - The email must be marked as primary (primary: true)
        - If multiple email addresses are provided, only the primary email will be used and all others will be ignored

                          For example, the value for the path "emails" must be an array of email objects as follows: ```json [
                            {
                              "value": "new.email@example.com",

                            }
                          ] ```
                          The value for the path "name" must be an object with the following properties: ```json {
                            "familyName": "Smith",
                            "givenName": "Barbara"
                          } ```
                          The value for the path "displayName" must be a string  representing the display name of the user.

      summary: Patch a Group
      description: |
        To update specific attributes of an existing group, send a PATCH request to
        `/Groups/$GROUP_ID`. The PATCH operation is defined by [RFC-7644 §3.5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.5.2).

        The request body MUST contain a valid SCIM PATCH request with a
        "schemas" value of "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp" and
        an "Operations" array with one or more PATCH operations (add, remove, or replace).

        Values in the request body for immutable or read-only fields (as defined in [RFC-7643 §4.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-4.2))
        will be ignored. Fields that are omitted from the request body will be left unchanged.

        Note: The Beyond Identity SCIM server currently does not support atomic
        PATCH operations. If a request contains multiple operations, the request
        may be partially applied.

        The Beyond Identity SCIM server also does not support modifying both a
        group's attributes and its membership in the same operation. For example, a PATCH
        request to update a group's display name and its membership should specify
        two separate operations, one to update the display name and the other to
        modify the membership.

        If a request contains multiple operations, the request may be partially applied:
          1. The server first validates the overall request schema and attribute types
          2. Operations are then applied sequentially in the order provided
          3. If any operation fails, processing stops immediately
          4. Previously successful operations remain applied
          5. The error response does not indicate which operation failed or which operations were applied
          6. To determine the current state, clients should issue a GET request after receiving an error

        This method can be used to provision roles to a user. 
        Role provisioning is performed by adding the user to the appropriate role group as a member.

        It is not possible to rename a role group or change its description.

          - eq (equals)
          - ne (not equals)
          - co (contains)

          - lt (less than)
          - ge (greater than or equal to)
          - le (less than or equal to)

        See individual methods for the supported attributes and operations.
