To ensure that users' devices are running a version or versions consistent with your organization's requirements, system administrators can create policy to:

*   Specify a range of Authenticator versions that can be installed on devices without the need to update.

*   Set a specific version of the Authenticator.
    
*   Enforce users to always update to the latest version.
    

:::note
This functionality is currently available for Windows and macOS platforms.

To create policy to manage the versions that can be installed on users' devices:

1.  From the Admin Console, select the **Settings** tab.  
    ![](/images/settings/settings_menu.png)
    
2.  From the **Settings** page, click the **Authenticator Version Control** tab to display the **Authentication Version Control** page. If existing version control policies have already been created, they will be listed here. Otherwise, the following screen is displayed.
