## Additional Intune information

This section covers details from Intune for your integration.

### Intune device directory matching

This integration leverages the Intune Managed Device ID, a unique string assigned to all devices in Intune. Beyond Identity does not use serial numbers to match devices to records.

### Integration rate limits

Microsoft Intune uses the rate limits below.

- 4000 requests per 20 second (per tenant for all apps)
- 2000 requests per 20 seconds (limit per app per tenant)

### Managed configurations for mobile devices

The Beyond Identity Platform Authenticator requires managed configurations for mobile devices. To map device information to the correct user and device population within Intune, managed configurations must be assigned. 

Mobile devices may be missing from Beyond Identity if they are not assigned with managed configurations. Confirm the accepted enrollment types can support managed applications for your organization. Not all MDM enrollment types are compatible with managed configurations.

### Intune integration compatibility

The Beyond Identity Platform Authenticator app must be installed from managed channels, such as through the Company Portal. Installations from the Android or Apple app stores are not compatible with the integration as they do not include managed configurations.
