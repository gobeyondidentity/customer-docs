## Additional CrowdStrike information

This section covers details from CrowdStrike for your integration.

### CrowdStrike Falcon device directory matching

This integration uses Agent ID (AID), a unique and device specific identifier created by CrowdStrike. Beyond Identity collects the Agent ID from both the data.zta file and from falconctl. Beyond Identity does not use serial numbers to match devices to records.

### Linux OS score

CrowdStrike reports the OS score for Linux as 0. CrowdStrike has no Linux OS assessment features.

### Integration rate limits

All requests to the CrowdStrike API have rate limits. The rate limit is calculated on a sliding window. The default rate limit for requests from a valid bearer token is 6,000 requests per minute per customer account. Each request in your customer account removes one request from that pool. This applies to any API endpoint or API client used for the request.
