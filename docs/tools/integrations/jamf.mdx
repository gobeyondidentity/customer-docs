This guide will walk you through setting up a Jamf Pro integration with Beyond Identity.

## Benefits of integrating Jamf with Beyond Identity

  **Ensure devices are found within Jamf Pro**

  Prevent unmanaged devices from accessing sensitive resources by leveraging Jamf Pro within Beyond Identity. Administrators are empowered to create policies using attributes such as:

  - Device Ownership Type
  - Supervision status
  - User Approved MDM
  - and many more

  **Ensure specific controls are configured correctly**

  It's not enough to simply know a device exists in the Jamf Pro device directory, it's just as important to ensure that the device is functional and configured correctly. This integration provides deep visibility into the security configuration of monitored devices, exposing the following attributes and more:
  - FileVault Status
  - Secure Boot Status
  - SIP Status
  - Firewall Status
  - Remote Login Enabled/Disabled

## Prerequisites
To ensure a smooth integration process, please confirm the availability of the following prerequisites and requirements.

## üü† Step 1 - Set up the Jamf Pro environment for first use
This section describes how to set up the Jamf environment for the first time.

**If you already have a Jamf environment configured, skip this section and go directly to Step 2 - Configure Jamf Pro to work with Beyond Identity.**

<details>
    <summary><p>Click here to view the steps.</p></summary>
    <h3>Set up the Jamf Pro environment</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Access the Jamf Pro environment by logging in to the following link as an administrator:
   https://yourinstancename.jamfcloud.com
   Replace "yourinstancename" with the name of your Jamf Pro instance.
   Login using your Jamf Pro admin username and password.</li>
    <li>Create additional users, if required. To create additional users, follow these steps:
   https://docs.jamf.com/10.28.0/jamf-pro/administrator-guide/Jamf_Pro_User_Accounts_and_Groups.html</li>
    <li>You can integrate with a third-party identity provider (IdP) to enable single sign-on (SSO) for portions of Jamf Pro. When SSO is configured and enabled, users are automatically redirected to your organization's IdP login page. After authentication, users obtain access to the resource they were attempting to access. To configure SAML, follow these steps:
   https://docs.jamf.com/10.28.0/jamf-pro/administrator-guide/Single_Sign-On.html</li>
   </ol>
    <h4>Prepare for Computer and Device Enrollment</h4>
    <p>**Apple Push Notification Certificate**</p>
    <p>Creation of an APNs certificate is required for enrollment of iOS devices and macOS devices. This certificate enables secure communication between Jamf Pro and Apple‚Äôs servers which support and enable MDM protocols, such as automated deployment of apps, configuration profiles and remote commands.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Please follow the instructions in the article below to create the APNs certificate, once you‚Äôve identified an appropriate Apple ID to use.</li>
    <p>https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/articles/111/generating-and-renewing-an-apple-push-notification-service-apns-certificate</p>
    </ul>
    <p>.</p>
    <h4>Configure User-initiated Enrollment Settings</h4>
    <p>While the majority of customer (production) environments utilize Automated enrollment using Apple Business Manager, for the demo environment, you can configure User-initiated enrollment.</p>¬†
    <p>Before enrolling devices, the server must be configured to support user-initiated enrollment. Follow the steps below to enable enrollment of both iOS and macOS devices.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Login to Jamf Pro.</li>
    <li>In the top-right corner of the page, click **Settings*.</li>
    <li>Click **User-Initiated Enrollment**.</li>
    <li>Click **Edit**.</li>
    <li>(Optional) Customize the default settings for the General and Messaging tabs as needed.</li>
    <li>Click **Platforms** and from the macOS tab, check the box to **Enable user-initiated enrollment for computers**.</li>
    <li>Enter any username for the administrative account that will be associated with the managed device in the **Username** field.</li>
    <p>**Note:** Although required, the configuration of this field is only relevant for the use of the Jamf Remote application.</p>
    <li>Click the iOS tab and check the box for **Enable user-initiated enrollment for institutionally owned iOS devices and personally owned iOS devices**.</li>
    <li>Click **Save** in the bottom-right corner of the page. Your environment is now configured to allow users to enroll devices without the use of Apple Business Manager.</li>
    </ol>
    \
    <h4>Enroll Computers</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>On the test device you intend to deploy the app to, navigate to https://yourInstanceName.jamfcloud.com/enroll</li>
    <li>Enter the credentials for the account used to log into Jamf Pro on the Login screen, and then click **Log in**.</li>
    <li>Click **Enroll** without entering anything in the text box on the Assign to user screen.</li>
        <p>**Important:** Entering data into the text box will prevent enrollment if no LDAP servers are configured (none are by default).</p>
    <li>When prompted, click **Continue**.¬†This will download a file ‚ÄúCA Certificate.mobileconfig‚Äù on your Mac.</li>
    <li>Click the file ‚ÄúCA Certificate.mobileconfig‚Äù.</li>
    <li>Go to **Mac System Preferences > Profiles**. You will see the CA Certificate listed there.</li>
    <li>Click **Install**.</li>
    <li>Click **Install** again. The CA Certificate is now installed.</li>
    <li>When prompted, click **Continue** to download the ‚ÄúenrollmentProfile.mobileconfig‚Äù on your Mac.</li>
    <li>Click the file ‚ÄúenrollmentProfile.mobileconfig‚Äù.</li>
    <li>Go to Mac System Preferences > Profiles.¬†You will see the MDM Profile listed there.</li>
    <li>Click **Install**.</li>
    <li>Click **Install** again.</li>
        <p>The MDM Profile is now installed. After the MDM profile has been installed, jamf binary, agents and other management tools will automatically begin installing in the background, please allow a few minutes for this process to complete before attempting to perform management tasks on the device.</p>
    <li>Quit the browser to ensure all Jamf Pro sessions are closed.</li>

## üîµ Jamf policy attributes
You can create policies that allow or deny authentication. The attributes below are available by default. For more information about policies, see <a href="https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/tools/policy">Policy</a>

| Attribute | Source | Description |
  |--|--|--|
  | Connection is | Jamf Pro API  | Checks whether the device is connected to Jamf.|
  | Computer Managed State is  | Jamf Pro API  | Checks whether the device is managed by Jamf.|
  | Mobile Device Managed State is | Jamf Pro API  | Checks whether the mobile device is managed by Jamf.|

If the computer or mobile device is "Not Managed," your rule can deny authentication. If you've purchased Device360, you can simulate the policy to see

**Note:** This rule will take effect immediately.


## üü† Step 4 - Push the Beyond Identity Authenticator to Mobile Devices

To leverage JAMF mobile attributes in the Beyond Identity policy and determine a managed state, the Beyond Identity Authenticator must be pushed to managed mobile devices with a specific app configuration.

1. Go to **Devices > Mobile Device Apps > + New**.

2. Click **App Store app or apps purchased in volume**.

3. Search for and add the Beyond Identity mobile application.

4. On the 'New Mobile Device App' page, go to **App Configuration** and enter the following:

   <dict><key>serialNumber</key><string>$SERIALNUMBER</string><key>DeviceUid</key><string>$UDID</string><key>JamfProID</key><string>$JSSID</string></dict>

5. Click **Save**.


## üîµ Step 5 - Test the MDM Authentication Policy

1. Login to the Beyond Identity Admin console first from a computer that is enrolled in Jamf Pro and then from a computer that is not enrolled in Jamf Pro.

2. Confirm that the policy behavior is as expected.

3. Click **Events** in the nav bar to ensure that the correct rule is triggered.


## üîµ Frequently Asked Questions

  **How are devices matched to the Jamf Pro device directory?**

  This integration leverages the Apple Unique Device Identifier (UDID). The UDID is a 24-character string assigned to all modern Apple devices. We **do not** use the serial number to match devices to records.

  **What rate limits apply to this integration?**

  No explicit rate limits are set for Jamf Pro.

  **Why aren't my iOS devices being found?**

  There are several reasons why an iOS device may fail to be found by Beyond Identity when it exists in the Jamf Pro device directory.

  iOS devices require a **managed configuration** to be provided in order to map device information into the Beyond Identity Platform Authenticator. The managed configuration must be assigned to the correct user and device population within Jamf Pro.

  Certain MDM enrollment types are incompatible with managed configurations. Ensure your accepted enrollment types fully support managed applications.

  For Jamf Pro integration compatibility, the cannot be Beyond Identity Platform Authenticator app cannot be installed directly from the Apple App Store, but instead  **must** be installed from a managed channel such as Self Service or be pushed to the device from Jamf Pro. Installations from the App Store will not include the managed configuration.
