# Welcome

Welcome to Beyond Identity's documentation resource center. Here you will find information on the various products we offer. These guides are intended to provide the information and tools needed to start a passwordless journey with Beyond Identity.

## About Beyond Identity
Beyond Identity helps customers deploy the strongest authentication primitives on the planet, eliminating shared secrets for customers at registration, login, and recovery, as well as from your database. Unique to Beyond Identity, users never have to pick up a second device to enroll or perform multi-factor authentication, passwords are never used on user flows. They can be removed from your database, and you can implement risk-based access controls using granular user and device risk captured in real-time. Backed by a cloud-native architecture, our platform was built for enterprise workloads.
