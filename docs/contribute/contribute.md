Thank you for taking an interest in contributing to the Beyond Identity Secure Workforce Documentation. 

We've built the documentation with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) and you can find the source code our [customer-docs GitHub repo][repo].

You're welcome to contribute to the documentation to help make it better and we want to make it possible for you to become a contributor. Additionally, anyone can open an issue about documentation or suggest a change with a [pull request (PR)][pr] to the [GitHub repository][repo]. 

This guide outlines the different ways that you can get involved. In addition, it provides some of the resources that are available to help you get started. 

If you plan to contribute, make sure to [set up your environment][get-started].
