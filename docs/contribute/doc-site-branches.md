Before starting the authoring work, you must understand the different branches to work on. You'll use your branch to work on content for a certain issue or feature, but you'll submit your Pull Request against one of the branches listed below: 

- **`main`** - protected branch
    
    Docs for https://deverloper.beyondidentity.com/. This branch contains the most recent stable release content.
    
- **`docs-staging`** - protected branch
    
    Docs for the upcoming release. When Secure Customer has a release, its `docs-staging` branch will be merged into `main`.
    
- Branches starting with **`release-`** contain archived release documentation for historical tracking, such as `release-xx`.

- **`active-development`** - protected branch (used for front-end and back-end development).
