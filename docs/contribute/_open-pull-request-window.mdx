1. Now that you've proposed and committed your changes, you must ask the owners to review your changes, which is done using a pull request (PR). 

   In the Open a pull request window, do the following:

   1. Select the branch.  

     :::note important  
     Always open all pull requests against the `main` branch unless it's for the upcoming next release. In that case, the PR should be opened against the `docs-staging` branch. 
     :::

   1. Ensure that the summary title is short but descriptive. If it is associated with a JIRA ticket, append it to the beginning in brackets, for example, **[MD-111] mac desktop login**. 

   1. Describe your changes. For more details, see [PR descriptions](./create-pull-request#pr-descriptions).

   1. In the **Reviewers** section, in the right panel, click the cog icon and select designated reviewersâ€”for example, another PM, a developer, and the technical writer. 

   1. Assign the PR to a specific reviewer if they are the main reviewer.  

   1. Select **Create pull request**.  If the pull request is a **work in progress** and not ready to be reviewed, select the **[Create draft pull request](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/#tag-your-work-in-progress)**. The difference is that the reviewers only get notified when the PR is *Open* rather than *Draft*.
