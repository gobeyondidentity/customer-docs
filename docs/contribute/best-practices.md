To promote consistency, follow the guidelines below and mentioned throughout to keep the process productive and beneficial for all involved.

### Content development

- Verify your content for technical accuracy before submitting your Pull Request.

- Consult with the Sr. Technical Writer when adding topics or want to propose changes to the content structure. The Sr. Technical Writer maintains the content's quality, reduces duplication, and provides a consistent user experience. They can also strategize how to deliver complex informationâ€”for example, adding an explainer video (<90 secs) can help with complex scenarios or issues.
  
**Process:**

What's worked well in the past, and what's common in tech companies (software companies in particular), is the SME/author of the content will consult with the technical writers to get a better understanding of where the content fits in the sidebar (left nav). During the conversation, they'll determine where the content fits. 

What's the topic type?  Reference, concept, how-to? In some cases, it can be a combination.
Can it be added to an existing topic to consolidate topics for clarity?  
Or does the content stand alone, like a how-to, overview, or reference topic?  

I'm not saying you don't need the tech writer's help between the consult and the Pull Request.  You absolutely can and should if guidance is needed.  In my experience, engineers often will continue collaborating with the tech writer even before they submit their Pull Request.

Once they get their content to the point where it's technically accurate, then they hand it off to the Technical Writer via a Pull Request. This is where the content review takes place.  If the technical writer has question regarding clarity of something, this is where the collaboration begins. 

Some developers and product managers are comfortable with this process, but some are not.  In that case, you can provide me with the document (Google Docs or text file) and I can convert it to markdown using Pandoc. 

### GitHub

- Create a *working branch* when introducing logically related changes. This helps you manage your changes through the workflow. We refer to it here as a working branch because it's a workspace to iterate or refine your changes until they can be integrated into the default branch.

- Keep your branch up-to-date.

- Check and remove unused personal branches periodically for easy maintenance. Usually, when your branch is merged, you can safely delete it.

### Commit messages

Ensure that your commit message is a proper sentence. Refer to this [guide on writing good commit messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

A properly formed git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:

***If applied, this commit will ....***


### Pull Requests

- Try to make the review cycle short.

- Make sure the markdown follows the style guidelines of this project.

- Perform a self-review of your markdown, especially spelling errors.

- Verify that the PR does not generate new warnings before pushing your changes. The best way is to run the clear command.
  
  ```nodejs
  npm run clear
  yarn build
  ```
