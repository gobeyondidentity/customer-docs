If you only need to fix a typo or clarify a sentence or section, this option is your best choice. It streamlines the process of reporting and correcting minor errors and omissions in the documentation.  

Despite all efforts, small grammar and spelling errors _do_ make their way into our published documents. While you can create GitHub issues to report mistakes, creating a PR to fix the issue is faster and easier when the option is available.

1. In the [repo][repo], navigate to the /docs folder and locate the file you want to edit. Then, select the pencil icon to edit the article. <br />

2. Edit the file in the web editor. Choose the **Preview** tab to check the formatting of your changes.<br />

3. When you're finished editing, scroll to the bottom of the page and propose your changes. <br />

   1. In the **Commit changes** area, enter a title and an optional description for your changes. The title will be the first line of the commit message. <br />

   2. Select the option to create a branch and then  **Propose changes** to commit your changes.<br />

4. Now that you've proposed and committed your changes, you need to ask the owners to review your changes. This is done using a pull request (PR).<br />

   Enter a title and a description for the PR, and then select **Create pull request**. You can select **Create a draft pull request** instead. The difference is that the reviewers are notified only when the PR is *Open* rather than *Draft*.<br />

That's it! Team members will review your PR and merge it when approved. You may get feedback requesting changes.
