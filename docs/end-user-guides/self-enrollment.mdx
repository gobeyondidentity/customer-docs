## Overview

Beyond Identity protects you and your organization from phishing attacks and other threats that come with using traditional passwords. Instead of relying on passwords, you use **passkeys**, which are secure credentials stored directly on your approved devices.

Getting started with passkeys is simple. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. You will receive an invitation email from your IT team to begin the passkey setup process.
2. The email will guide you to download and install the Beyond Identity Authenticator for your device. The Authenticator is available for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux.
3. After you install the Authenticator, a passkey will be created on that device. You can then use the app to add/extend passkeys to other devices, such as your smartphone or tablet.

Once set up, you will be able to sign in securely from any of your approved devices, without ever needing to enter a password.

:::caution
Only enroll passkeys on devices you control and are approved by your organization.
