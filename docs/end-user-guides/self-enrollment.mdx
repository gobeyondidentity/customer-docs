## Overview

In this article, you’ll learn how to set up your device with a passkey so you can log in securely without passwords.

**Important**: In this process, you’re actually enrolling a credential that is tied to you (your identity), not just the device itself. Your device simply stores this passkey credential. A single device can hold multiple passkeys, and you can generate passkeys for multiple devices.

There are several ways to set up a passkey on your device:

    - Email with Magic Link – A link sent via email that, when clicked, starts the passkey enrollment process.

    - Magic Link (without email) – A direct link that can be shared to start enrollment.

    - 9-digit code – A numeric code entered to start enrollment.

    - Credential Extension – Extend an existing passkey from one device to another.

    - IDP Authorization – Use your identity provider to authorize the enrollment of a new passkey via the user console.

These flows all achieve the same result: your device will have a new passkey credential bound to your identity, enabling secure, passwordless access.

Only enroll passkeys on devices you control and are approved by your organization.
