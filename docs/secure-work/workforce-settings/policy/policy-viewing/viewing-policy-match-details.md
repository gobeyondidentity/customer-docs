Viewing Policy Match Details
============================

System administrators can view a history of policy match events along with the policy (the set of rules) that were in effect at the time of the event. This allows administrators to view and also troubleshoot policy matches.

To view the policy associated with the policy event:

1.  From the [Admin Console](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/admin-console/admin-console-login), select the **Events** tab.
2.  From the **Events** page, select `Policy` from the **Event** filter drop-down menu.

3.  To reduce the number of events displayed, you can apply additional filters such as the **Date Range** and **Policy Version History**. See [Viewing Event Information](/docs/secure-work/events/viewing-event-information) for additional information.
4.  From the **Events** column, locate and select the  event you want to view the event details for.
