Deactivating and Activating Users
=================================

Deactivate a User
-----------------

When a user is deactivated, they are still in the tenant but lose all access and cannot authenticate. To deactivate a user:

1.  Select **Users** from the left menu of the [Admin Console](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/admin-console/admin-console-login).
2.  From the Users page, search for the user. Use the **Search** field to easily find the user based on the **name**, **email**, or **ID**.
