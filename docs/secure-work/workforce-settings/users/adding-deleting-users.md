Adding and Deleting Users
=========================

Adding Users
------------

To allow your workforce to utilize Beyond Identity, each user must be added within your Tenant.  To add a user:

1.  Select **Users** from the left menu of the [Admin Console](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/admin-console/admin-console-login).
2.  The Users page displays the list of users currently in your tenant.  Click **Add Tenant**.
3.  From the Add User dialog, provide the following information, and then click **Save Changes**:
    1.  External ID
    2.  Email address
    3.  Username
    4.  Display Name  
        ![](/images/users/add_user_john_racer.PNG)301
4.  The user is added to the end of the list on the Users page.

Deleting Users
--------------

When a user is deleted from your tenant, they longer have access to and cannot authenticate to your apps using Beyond Identity. To delete a user:

1.  Select **Users** from the left menu of the [Admin Console](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/admin-console/admin-console-login).
2.  From the Users page, search for the user. Use the **Search** field to easily find the user based on the **name**, **email**, or **ID**.

3.  Once the user is located and selected, click **Delete User**.

4.  A dialog is displayed asking if you want to delete the user. Click **Delete**.
