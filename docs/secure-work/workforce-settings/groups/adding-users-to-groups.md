Adding Users to Groups
======================

Users can be added to one or more groups. To add a user to a group:

1.  Log into the [Admin console](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/admin-console/admin-console-login) and from the Home screen, select the **Groups** tab.
2.  The Groups page displays the list of groups currently in your tenant. 
3.  Locate and then click on the desired group. For example, **Require** **Intune on Windows**.
