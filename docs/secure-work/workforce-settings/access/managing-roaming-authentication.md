Managing Roaming Authentication
===============================

The Beyond Identity Platform Authenticator can be configured to allow a user to switch between different machines that are joined in an Azure Active Directory domain without having to re-enroll each time when logging into a different machine. This is accomplished by creating a profile containing a shared credential that can roam between different machines within the Active Directory. Roaming authentication allows allows a user to switch between different machines without having to re-enroll each time when logging into a different machine.  To enable or disable roaming authentication.

2.  From the **Settings** page, click the **AUTHENTICATIONS OPTIONS** edit icon under the **TENANT INFO** tab.
