Managing Updates and Notifications
==================================

By default, users are notified any time an update is available. Users can also check for updates at any time by selecting the **Check for Updates** drop-down menu item. These options allow users to download and install the latest functionality available.

Since the downloading and use of the Beyond Identity software is controlled and managed by each company using the software, a company may want to manage installations and updates. There are several reasons why a company may want to manage the installation of software. These include:

*   Verifying a release to ensure there are no issues with the software.
*   Verifying a release to ensure it does not cause issues with other applications within their environment.
*   Ensuring everyone within the organization is using the same release of software.

Depending on the company’s policy regarding downloading software, automatic notifications and the ability to manually check for updates can be turned off, restricting users from downloading and installing updates. The left image shows the **Check for Updates** item included in the drop-down menu when enabled and the right image shows the menu item removed after notifications have been disabled.

The method to disable update notifications and to check for updates depends on the platform. See [Managing Update Notifications on Windows Devices](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/updates/managing-update-notifications-on-windows-devices) and [Managing Update Notifications on macOS Devices](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/updates/managing-update-notifications-on-macos-devices).
