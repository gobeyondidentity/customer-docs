Google Workspace Integration
============================

This guide provides information on how to:

*   Set up Beyond Identity as a passwordless authentication solution for your Google Workspace environment.
    
*   Set up Google Workspace to use Beyond Identity as an Identity Provider.
    

Before you Begin
----------------

This section enumerates some items you should be aware of before configuring Google as an SSO provider with Beyond Identity.

*   Users who are administrators in Google Workspace cannot use IdP Delegation and must always use their Google password as their primary factor of authentication.
*   Multi-factor options are limited in Google Workspace in comparison to most SSO providers. Beyond Identity cannot be used as a multi-factor step-up option for continuous authentication. For multi-factor options in Google Workspace, refer to the 2-Step Verification Methods under the Google support page.
*   Google does not currently support Beyond Identity for SCIM provisioning. The Beyond Identity team is currently working to get the BI solution into the Google Marketplace to enable this functionality.

Prerequisites
-------------

Ensure that you a Google Administrator account to:

*   Add/edit users into the Google Directory.
*   Add/edit Identity Providers in **Security > Authentication > Set up single-on (SSO) with a 3rd part IdP**.

#### Step 9. Configure SCIM for User & Group Provisioning

Google Workspace does not support SCIM for non-gallery applications currently. We are working with Google to enable this feature for Beyond Identity.

#### Step 10. Setting up Test Users

To set up test users, perform the following steps:

##### 10.1 User Enrollment

1.  To enroll a user in the Beyond Identity experience, assign the user to the **BI\_Users** group.
    1.  Click **Directory > Groups**.
    2.  Select the **BI\_Users** group.
    3.  Click **Add Members**.
    4.  Find users and assign them to this group.
    5.  Click **Add to Group**.
2.  Create users in the Beyond Identity directory with following parameters:
    1.  `External ID` (e.g., same as UPN)
    2.  `Email`
    3.  `Username`
    4.  `Display Name`
3.  Enrolled users will receive an email from Beyond Identity welcoming them to the new Identity Provider.  
    ![](/images/google-workspace/bi_get_auth_reg_cred.png)
4.  Each enrolled user will be asked to perform the steps below:
    *   **Step 1: Download the Beyond Identity Authenticator to their device.**  
        When the user clicks **View Download Options**, the Beyond Identity Authenticator downloads page will open in a browser with all supported platforms displayed. The user should download and install the Beyond Identity Authenticator on their device if they have not already. Once the Authenticator is installed on the device, proceed to Step 2 as there is not yet a user credential associated with the Authenticator on that device.
    *   **Step 2: Register their Credential in the Beyond Identity IdP.**  
       When the user clicks on Step 2 **Register New Credential**, the userâ€™s credential will get enrolled in the Beyond Identity service, users who click Step 2 will be taken to the Beyond Identity Authenticator where they will see the progress of their credential registration. Once completed, the user will see the credentials in the Authenticator.   
        ![](/images/google-workspace/bi_credential.png)

##### 10.2 User Authentication (Signing In)

1.  Each enrolled user can visit any application supported by your SSO to sign into their corporate applications. 
    
2.  The SSO-supported application will ask the user to enter their username. 
    
3.  Once the username is submitted, a prompt to use or open the Beyond Identity app for authentication will display for the user.
    
4.  The user should click affirmatively on the prompt to be signed into their application, without the use of a password. The Beyond Identity app along with a success notification will display.
    

##### 10.3 User Deprovisioning

1.  To deprovision a user from the Beyond Identity experience, remove the user from the `BI\_Users` Group.
    1.  Click **Directory > Groups**.
    2.  Select the **BI\_Users** group.
    3.  Click **Manage Members**.
    4.  Click the **-** sign next to the user's name in the **Members** column.
    5.  Click **Remove Members**.
2.  To remove or suspend users from Beyond Identity cloud, log into the admin console and go to the **Users** tab.
    1.  Select the user by clicking on their name.
    2.  Once on the user-specific page, click **Deactivate** to suspend the user or **Delete User** to permanently delete the user from Beyond Identity cloud.
