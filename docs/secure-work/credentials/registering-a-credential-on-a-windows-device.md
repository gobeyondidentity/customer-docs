Once you tap **Download for Windows**, the file will be downloaded to your **Downloads** folder on your system.

#### 2\. Register your Credential

After the Beyond Identity Authenticator has downloaded, go back to the registration email and tap **Register New Credential**.

This will initiate the registration process and once complete you’ll receive a message that the credential was registered successfully.
