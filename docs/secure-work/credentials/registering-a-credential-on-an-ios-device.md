Registering a Credential on an iOS Device
=========================================

This article assumes that you have already received a welcome registration email that has been sent from your IT administrator.

#### Step 1. Download the Authenticator

From the email you can tap the “View Download Options”, which will then allow you to tap “Download for Android”.

Once you tap **Download for Android**, you’ll be redirected to the Google Play Store and then be able to download the Beyond Identity Authenticator.

#### 2\. Register your Credential

After the Beyond Identity Authenticator has downloaded, go back to the registration email and tap **Register New Credential**.

This will initiate the registration process and once complete you’ll receive a message that the credential was registered successfully.
