Once a user is deleted, they no longer have log in access. Note: Before requesting a tenant to be deleted, make sure users can authenticate using another method.

### Step 1: Delete or Deactivate a User or Tenant

1.  From the [Admin Console]<!-- (../Admin_Console) -->, select the **Users** tab.
2.  Locate the appropriate user by one of the following methods:
    1.  Typing the `name`, `email`, or `ID` in the search box.
    2.  Scrolling through the list.
3.  Click on the `user name`.
4.  From the user name window, perform on the following:
    1.  To deactivate the user, click **Deactivate**.
    2.  To permanently delete the user, click **Delete User**.

### Step 2: Create a Delete Request

To request a tenant or specific user to be deleted, do one of the following: 

#### **Step 2A**

1.  Open a [Delete Request](https://beyondidentity.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/5/user/login?destination=portal%2F5%2Fgroup%2F16%2Fcreate%2F127) via the Customer Support Portal.
2.  From the **Customer Support** dialog:
    1.   Make sure the **Delete Request** option is selected.
    2.  Provide the `Tenant ID` or `User ID` in the **Summary** field.
    3.  Add a brief description of the reason for the request. (Optional)

#### **Step 2B**

1.  Send an email to [support@beyondidentity.com](https://beyondidentity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CS/pages/2187395076/Tenant+or+User+Deletion#b)-Send-Delete-Request-to-support%40beyondidentity.com)  containing the following information:
    1.  **Subject:** Delete Request for <`TENANT_ID` or `USER_ID`\>
    2.  **Message:** Brief description if needed

### Step 3: Respond to the Confirmation Request

Beyond Identity will confirm from the named account contact person for deletion. Without a response from the named person, Beyond Identity will not proceed.

### Step 4: Beyond Identity Will Confirm Delete Request Processed

The Beyond Identity team will delete the tenant/user from the platform. Once the data deletion is complete, the support team will confirm the request processed. This process will take 5 business days.
