If the data log is not available through the Admin Console, or you need some larger subset of data that is not provided via API, you can request the data as follows:

### Step 1. Create a Data Access Request

To create a data access request, perform one of the following:

1.  **Open a Data Access Request via Customer Support Portal**  
    Create a specific type of ticket for [requesting data access](https://support.beyondidentity.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=6747444827927).

2.  **Send a Data Access Request to support@beyondidentity.com  
    **Your email address:** Provide your address
	**Subject:** Request Access for `<TENANT_ID or USER_ID>` Data  
    **Message:** Provide a brief description and justification

### Step 2. Respond to the Confirmation Request

Beyond Identity will send a confirmation request to the individual associated with the account. Without a response from the named individual, Beyond Identity will not proceed.

### Step 3. Beyond Identity Will Send the Data as Closure

The Beyond Identity data team will process the data export. Once the data export is complete, the support team will confirm the request processed and will provide the content. This process will take 5 business days.
