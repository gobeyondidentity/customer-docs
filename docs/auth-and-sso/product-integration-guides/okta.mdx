## Prerequisites

To ensure a smooth integration process, please confirm the availability of the following prerequisites and settings within your Okta account.

### ðŸŸ  Create an Okta Account

This guide assume you already have an Okta account provisioned. If you need to create one, [Click here](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

### ðŸŸ  Okta Account Access

Ensure you have either **Super Admin** or **Organization Admin** privileges.

<details>
    <summary><p>Why is this required?</p></summary>
    <p>Having <strong>Super Admin</strong> or <strong>Organization Admin</strong> privileges enables you to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add or edit attributes and their mappings via <code>Directory &gt; Profile Editor</code>.</li>
        <li>Add or edit Identity Providers (IdPs) through <code>Security &gt; Identity Providers</code>.</li>
        <li>Add or edit routing rules in <code>Security &gt; Identity Providers &gt; Routing Rules</code>.</li>
    </ul>
</details>

### ðŸŸ  Okta Feature Verification

Confirm that the following features are active on your account:

<details>
    <summary><p>OpenID Connect IdP</p></summary>
    <p>Verify this by checking if you can navigate to <code>Security &gt; Identity provider &gt; Add Identity Provider &gt; Add OpenID Connect IdP</code>. If this option is unavailable, you will need to contact Okta support to enable it.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary><p>Routing Rules</p></summary>
    <p>Ensure the "Routing Rules" tab is visible under <code>Security &gt; Identity Providers</code>. If it is missing, contact Okta support to request its activation on the Identity Provider page.</p>

## 1. Enable User Syncing between Okta and Beyond Identity

### ðŸŸ  Update User Profile Attributes

To enable Okta to automatically direct users registered with Beyond Identity towards a passwordless authentication flow, define a custom attribute named "byndidRegistered" on an Okta User's profile.

<Arcade clip={Clip.OktaIntegrationGuideCreateByndidRegisteredAttribute} />

Once you've created the "byndidRegistered" attribute, update the profile source to inherit from Okta.

<Arcade clip={Clip.OktaIntegrationGuideUpdateByndidRegisteredAttribute} />

### ðŸŸ  Create a Beyond Identity Group

To enable specific users to authenticate passwordlessly with Beyond Identity, you shold create a group and include those users in it.

<Arcade clip={Clip.OktaIntegrationGuideGroupCreation} />

### ðŸŸ  Generate an API Token

To successfully integrate Beyond Identity with Okta, the first step involves registering a credential on the user's device. Following this successful registration, Beyond Identity must notify Okta that the user is now equipped to authenticate using Beyond Identity. This notification is facilitated through the `byndidRegistered` attribute, which you would have configured previously. It is necessary for Beyond Identity to possess an Okta API token in order to communicate the update to Okta.

<Arcade clip={Clip.OktaIntegrationGuideAPITokenGeneration} />

### ðŸ”µ Create a Directory Integration
- Go to directory integrations -> Add Directory -> Okta
- Enter your Okta API token where requested
- Select bearer token for SCIM -> click save
- Keep the bearer token handy

### ðŸŸ  Synchronize Users via SCIM
- In Okta Set up a SCIM application
- Paste in SCIM information (bearer token) from BI directory integration

TODO: Add arcade here

## 2. Enable Authentication Using Beyond Identity


### ðŸ”µ Create an Identity Provider in Beyond Identity

Enable Okta to use Beyond Identity for authentication by setting it up as an identity provider. This is achieved by creating an identity provider within the Beyond Identity Admin Console. After creating the identity provider, the status will display `Not Installed`. This indicates that you will need to revisit this section to enter a redirect URI once you have set up an identity provider in Okta.

<Arcade clip={Clip.OktaIntegrationGuideCreateBeyondIdentityIdp} />

Notice the important values section at the bottom of the Identity Provider creation screen. You will need to copy a few of these URLs over to Okta in a later section.
