To ensure a smooth integration process, please confirm the availability of the following prerequisites and settings within your Okta account.

### ðŸŸ  Create an Okta Account

This guide assume you already have an Okta account provisioned. If you need to create one, [Click here](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

### ðŸŸ  Okta Account Access

Ensure you have either **Super Admin** or **Organization Admin** privileges.

<details>
    <summary><p>Why is this required?</p></summary>
    <p>Having <strong>Super Admin</strong> or <strong>Organization Admin</strong> privileges enables you to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add or edit attributes and their mappings via <code>Directory &gt; Profile Editor</code>.</li>
        <li>Add or edit Identity Providers (IdPs) through <code>Security &gt; Identity Providers</code>.</li>
        <li>Add or edit routing rules in <code>Security &gt; Identity Providers &gt; Routing Rules</code>.</li>
    </ul>
</details>

### ðŸŸ  Okta Feature Verification

Confirm that the following features are active on your account:

<details>
    <summary><p>OpenID Connect IdP</p></summary>
    <p>Verify this by checking if you can navigate to <code>Security &gt; Identity provider &gt; Add Identity Provider &gt; Add OpenID Connect IdP</code>. If this option is unavailable, you will need to contact Okta support to enable it.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary><p>Routing Rules</p></summary>

## 1. Set Up Okta

### ðŸŸ  Update User Profile Attributes

To enable Okta to automatically direct users registered with Beyond Identity towards a passwordless authentication flow, define a custom attribute named "byndidRegistered" on an Okta User's profile.

<Arcade clip={Clip.OktaConfigurationUserSettings} />

### ðŸŸ  Create a Beyond Identity Group

To enable specific users to authenticate passwordlessly with Beyond Identity, you shold create a group and include those users in it.

<Arcade clip={Clip.OktaConfigurationAddGroup} />

### ðŸŸ  Generate an API Token

To successfully integrate Beyond Identity with Okta, the first step involves registering a credential on the user's device. Following this successful registration, Beyond Identity must notify Okta that the user is now equipped to authenticate using Beyond Identity. This notification is facilitated through the `byndidRegistered` attribute, which you would have configured previously. It is necessary for Beyond Identity to possess an Okta API token in order to communicate the update to Okta.
