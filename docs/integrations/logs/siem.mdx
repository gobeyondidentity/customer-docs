Beyond Identity's Secure Access Platform provides a dedicated view for SIEM Integrations logs. 

### How it works

When a SIEM event push occurs, this view will provide information on the success or failure of that push.

### Where to view

You can navigate to the logs view by clicking the row of your installed SIEM integration, and then navigating to the `Logs` tab.

### Types of errors

- 50x - This indicates an error upstream with the integration provider. If the issue persists, we recommend reaching out to the integration provider to learn more.

- 40x - This indicates an issue with the SIEM connection and might require user intervention. 

- Generic Error - This indicates an issue with the Beyond Identity system. If this issue persists, please contact Beyond Identity support.

### Filter by date

You can filter by date range to get a customized view for these errors. History goes back 90 days.

### Empty logs

If the logs view is empty, then the system has not attempted to push event data to the SIEM.
