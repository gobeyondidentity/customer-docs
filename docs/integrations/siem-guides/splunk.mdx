## Stage summary

The integration setup consists of the two stages below. Each stage covers the initial set up for continuing the integration process on each respective platform. Follow the guide in linear order to complete the integration.

| Stage | Summary | Splunk | Beyond Identity |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [I](#stage-i) | Initial configuration | - [Create HTTP event collector](#-create-http-event-collector)<br></br>- [Additional Splunk configurations](#-additional-splunk-configurations)<br></br>- [Configure HTTP Event Collector with SSL certificate](#-configure-http-event-collector-with-ssl-certificate)<br></br>- [HTTP Event Collector port](#-http-event-collector-port) | - [Add integration in Beyond Identity](#-add-integration-in-beyond-identity) |
| [II](#stage-ii) | Set up Beyond Identity integration and confirm logs | - [Verify logs in Splunk](#-verify-logs-in-splunk) | - [Configure Splunk integration in Beyond Identity](#-configure-splunk-integration-in-beyond-identity)<br></br>- [View SIEM integration logs](#-view-siem-integration-logs) |

# Steps

Follow the steps in the sections below to complete your SIEM integration with Beyond Identity.

## Legend

The sections below use these two color codings to identify the steps for separate platforms.

ðŸ”µ Beyond Identity: Beyond Identity platform tasks are highlighted in blue.

ðŸŸ  Splunk: Splunk platform tasks are highlighted in orange.

## Stage I

The sections in this stage are for the intial setup of the integration between the two platforms.

### ðŸŸ  Create HTTP event collector

This section has the steps for covering the setup 

1. Navigate and login to your Splunk Cloud administrator console.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Click **Data inputs** in the dropdown menu.
4. On the **Data inputs** screen, click **Add new**.
5. Input `BI_events_http` in the name field for the HTTP Event Collector and add a description.
6. Maintain the default for the other fields and click **Next**.
7. Next to **Available items**, click **add all**. This action populates the **Selected item(s) **section.
8. Under the **Default Index** dropdown, select **main**.
9. Click **Review** to review the settings.
10. Click **Submit**. This prompts the Token has been created successfully screen and shows the new HTTP Event Collector.
11. Copy the token value and save it in a secure location.

### ðŸŸ  Additional Splunk configurations

The section here covers the remaining setup for Splunk configurations.

#### ðŸŸ  Configure HTTP Event Collector with SSL certificate

This section covers SSL instructions for Splunk Enterprise. Follow the specifications below to configure the integration.

:::note
This functionality is not available for trial accounts.
:::

The default SSL certificate deployed with HTTP Event Collector has the Subject `CN=SplunkServerDefaultCert`. The SSL handshake requires the subject in the certificate to match the host name of HTTP Event collector URL. 

Copy an SSL certificate, for example using `letsencrypt`, with host name as the subject and the full CA certificate chain file in PEM format.

Refer to the [Splunk HTTP Event Collector reference documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.2.0/Admin/Inputsconf#http:_.28HTTP_Event_Collector.29) for more. 
 
Set the following specifications for receiving Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)communication underneath this stanza name.

```
serverCert = <path>
```

The full path to the server certificate Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) format file. PEM is the most common text-based storage format for SSL certificate files. No default.


#### ðŸŸ  HTTP Event Collector port

Open HTTP Event Collector port `8080`. Splunk Cloud HTTP Event collector listens on port 8088 by default. This port is open for SSL traffic in the firewall for Beyond Identity event integration to work.
