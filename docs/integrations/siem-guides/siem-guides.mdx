# Overview

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integrations are for collecting and monitoring data to support threat detection, compliance, and security incident management. Beyond Identity sends this data using your configuration settings in the Beyond Identity Console.

## Integration process

The Beyond Identity SIEM integration process has a general flow and pattern for the platforms. View the points below for more details.

- Navigate to your SIEM platform
- Create an API key from that platform
- In your Beyond Identity Console, add the API key to the integration
- Verify the communication in your SIEM platform
- Monitor log activity in Beyond Identity
