## üü† Set up initial Jamf Pro environment

This section describes setting up the üü† Jamf Pro environment for the first time. If you already have a Jamf environment configured, go directly to [Configure Jamf Pro to integrate with Beyond Identity](#-configure-jamf-pro-to-integrate-with-beyond-identity).

<details>
    <summary><p>Click here to view the steps.</p></summary>
    <h3>Set up the Jamf Pro environment</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Access the Jamf Pro environment by logging in to the following link as an administrator:
   https://yourinstancename.jamfcloud.com
   Replace "yourinstancename" with the name of your Jamf Pro instance.
   Login using your Jamf Pro admin username and password.</li>
    <li>Create additional users, if required. To create additional users, follow these steps:
   https://docs.jamf.com/10.28.0/jamf-pro/administrator-guide/Jamf_Pro_User_Accounts_and_Groups.html</li>
    <li>Integrate with a third-party identity provider (IdP) to enable single sign-on (SSO) for portions of Jamf Pro. When SSO is configured and enabled, users are automatically redirected to your organization's IdP login page. After authentication, users obtain access to the resource they were attempting to access. To configure SAML, follow these steps:
   https://docs.jamf.com/10.28.0/jamf-pro/administrator-guide/Single_Sign-On.html</li>
   </ol>
    <h4>Prepare for Computer and Device Enrollment</h4>
    <p>**Apple Push Notification Certificate**</p>
    <p>Creation of an APNs certificate is required for enrollment of iOS devices and macOS devices. This certificate enables secure communication between Jamf Pro and Apple's servers which support and enable MDM protocols, such as automated deployment of apps, configuration profiles and remote commands.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Please follow the instructions in the article below to create the APNs certificate, once you've identified an appropriate Apple ID to use.</li>
    <p>https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/articles/111/generating-and-renewing-an-apple-push-notification-service-apns-certificate</p>
    </ul>
    <p>.</p>
    <h4>Configure User-initiated Enrollment Settings</h4>
    <p>While the majority of customer (production) environments utilize Automated enrollment using Apple Business Manager, for the demo environment, you can configure User-initiated enrollment.</p> 
    <p>Before enrolling devices, the server must be configured to support user-initiated enrollment. Follow the steps below to enable enrollment of both iOS and macOS devices.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Login to Jamf Pro.</li>
    <li>In the top-right corner of the page, click **Settings*.</li>
    <li>Click **User-Initiated Enrollment**.</li>
    <li>Click **Edit**.</li>
    <li>(Optional) Customize the default settings for the General and Messaging tabs as needed.</li>
    <li>Click **Platforms** and from the macOS tab, check the box to **Enable user-initiated enrollment for computers**.</li>
    <li>Enter any username for the administrative account that will be associated with the managed device in the **Username** field.</li>
    <p>**Note:** Although required, the configuration of this field is only relevant for the use of the Jamf Remote application.</p>
    <li>Click the iOS tab and check the box for **Enable user-initiated enrollment for institutionally owned iOS devices and personally owned iOS devices**.</li>
    <li>Click **Save** in the bottom-right corner of the page. Your environment is now configured to allow users to enroll devices without the use of Apple Business Manager.</li>
    </ol>
    \
    <h4>Enroll Computers</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>On the test device you intend to deploy the app to, navigate to https://yourInstanceName.jamfcloud.com/enroll</li>
    <li>Enter the credentials for the account used to log into Jamf Pro on the Login screen, and then click **Log in**.</li>
    <li>Click **Enroll** without entering anything in the text box on the Assign to user screen.</li>
        <p>**Important:** Entering data into the text box will prevent enrollment if no LDAP servers are configured (none are by default).</p>
    <li>When prompted, click **Continue**. This will download a file ‚ÄúCA Certificate.mobileconfig‚Äù on your Mac.</li>
    <li>Click the file ‚ÄúCA Certificate.mobileconfig‚Äù.</li>
    <li>Go to **Mac System Preferences > Profiles**. You will see the CA Certificate listed there.</li>
    <li>Click **Install**.</li>
    <li>Click **Install** again. The CA Certificate is now installed.</li>
    <li>When prompted, click **Continue** to download the ‚ÄúenrollmentProfile.mobileconfig‚Äù on your Mac.</li>

## Additional Jamf information

This section covers details from Jamf for your integration.

### Jamf device directory matching

This integration uses Apple Unique Device Identifier (UDID), a 24-character string assigned to all modern Apple devices. Beyond Identity does not use serial numbers to match devices to records.

### Managed configurations for mobile devices

The Beyond Identity Platform Authenticator requires managed configurations for mobile devices. To map device information to the correct user and device population within Jamf Pro, managed configurations must be assigned. Mobile devices may be missing from Beyond Identity if they are not assigned with managed configurations. Confirm the accepted enrollment types can support managed applications for your organization. Not all MDM enrollment types are compatible with managed configurations.

### Jamf Pro integration compatibility

The Beyond Identity Platform Authenticator app must be installed from managed channels, such as through Self Service or pushed to the device by Jamf Pro directly. Installations from the Apple App Store are not compatible with the integration as they do not include managed configurations.
