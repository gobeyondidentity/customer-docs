# Beyond Identity Secure Work Events Data Integration with Splunk Cloud and Enterprise

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for integrating event data from the Secure Work platform into Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise.

## Overview

This integration allows security teams and administrators to centralize logs, visualize activity, and generate alerts in Splunk using events from Secure Work.  

By following this guide, you will learn how to:

- Configure the Secure Work platform to send event data.
- Connect and authenticate with Splunk Cloud or Splunk Enterprise.
- Verify that data is flowing into Splunk. 

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the integration, ensure you have:

- A configured Secure Work tenant with access to the admin console and permissions to generate API keys or configure event forwarding.  
- An admin-level Splunk Cloud or Splunk Enterprise account.  
- Network connectivity allowing outbound connections from Secure Work to Splunk. 

## Steps

### Creating an HTTP Event Collector

1. Access your Splunk Cloud or Enterprise admin console and log in with admin privileges.

    - **HEC Token:** Paste the token copied from the Splunk console.
    - **HEC Host:** The URL of your Splunk instance (without `https://`).
    - **HEC Port:** Enter `8088`.  
    - **Events:** Select which event types you want forwarded to Splunk.
    - **Threat Signals:** Choose which threat signals you want forwarded.
    - **Status:** Toggle to **ACTIVE**.

### Verify Events in Splunk Cloud

After configuration, verify that events are flowing into Splunk:

1. Log in to your Splunk Cloud instance.
2. Run a search similar to:

```
index="main" source="BI_events_http" actor.tenant_id="TENANT_CONFIGURED"
```

- Replace `source` with the source name you defined.
- Replace `actor.tenant_id` with your configured tenant ID.

If successful, events matching the search will be returned.
