## Overview

Creating **Roles** allows administrators to restrict identity permissions for performing privileged actions in the Secure Access admin console. For example, administrators can create and define a role called "Help Desk Admins" with permissions to perform limited privileged actions, like sending enrollment emails but not deleting identities.

### Sensitive or Administrative Permissions (Feature-flagged)

Some permissions are **sensitive scopes** because they can be misused for privilege escalation or compromise (for example, modifying privileged identities, adding oneself to privileged groups, or generating credential-binding links for higher-privileged users). To reduce risk, when **any** sensitive scope is selected, **all** sensitive scopes must be selected together. This effectively makes the role **Super Admin–equivalent** and prevents partially privileged “backdoor” roles. **This enforcement is currently feature-flag controlled (not GA).** 


#### Sensitive Scopes (current set)

- `identities:update` — Could change a higher-privileged user’s email to an attacker-controlled email to take over that account.   
- `groups:update` — Could add oneself to a privileged group and escalate access.   
- `applications:read-secrets` — Could expose confidential application credentials.   
- `credential-binding-jobs:create-links` — Could generate a passkey binding link for a privileged identity and use it to impersonate that user.   
- `credential-binding-jobs:create` — Similar impersonation risk when used against privileged identities.   
- `roles:update` — Could silently widen privileges for other admins or self. 

> **Enforcement rule (when the feature flag is enabled):** Selecting **any one** of the above requires **all** to be selected. Otherwise, remove sensitive scopes and design a least-privilege role instead. 

**Example validation message (when enforcement is on):**

> **All sensitive scopes must be selected together.**  
> Include all sensitive permissions or remove them from the role.

### Recommended Service Desk Role (Least Privilege)

For a support-focused **Service Desk** role, use the **non-sensitive** scopes below. This allows common user lifecycle work without exposing sensitive operations. If a task requires sensitive scopes, escalate to a **Super Admin**. 

**Identity Management**  
- `identities:read`  
- `identities:create`  
- `identities:delete`  
- *Do not include* `identities:update` 

**Passkey Management**  
- `credential-binding-jobs:create-email` (send enrollment emails)  
- *Do not include* `credential-binding-jobs:create` or `credential-binding-jobs:create-links` 

**Groups & Access**  
- `groups:read`  
- *Do not include* `groups:update` 

**Read-Only**  
- `policies:read`  
- `applications:read` (no secrets)

### FAQ

**Why require all sensitive scopes together?**  
To prevent partially privileged roles that can be chained into privilege escalation; the platform enforces this automatically for tenants with the feature flag enabled. 

**Is the enforcement GA?**  
No. It is feature-flagged and may be enabled for certain customers/tenants.
