## How to Suspend Users

In many cases, **suspending** a user is a more appropriate action than permanently deleting them.

When a user goes on leave, temporarily changes roles, or their access needs to be paused for compliance or security reasons, IT administrators should suspend the account instead of deleting it.

Suspending users helps ensure that access is immediately blocked while preserving the userâ€™s identity, settings, and audit trail. This approach allows for easier reactivation when appropriate and supports better control over temporary access restrictions without permanent data loss.
