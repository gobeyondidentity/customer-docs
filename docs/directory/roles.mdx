## Customize Role Permissions

You can create and assign custom roles with granular, least-privilege permissions, specifying exactly which actions each role can perform, for example, allowing help desk staff to reset credentials or enabling application owners to manage app assignments. 

This feature helps reduce the number of high-privilege accounts, lowers the attack surface and insider risk, and supports compliance with access control requirements.
