## Overview

Managing identities is a vital part of maintaining your organization’s security with Secure Access, and removing users becomes necessary to protect your systems and data.

When a user leaves the company, changes roles, or no longer needs access due to project completion, it's important for IT administrators to promptly delete their account.

Deleting users helps ensure that only authorized personnel retain access, thereby strengthening your organization’s overall security posture.
