**Early Access**

## Overview

Administrators can create and manage Secure Work Realms within the Secure Access Platform. Realms are distinct identity directories within a single tenant, each configurable to support employee passwordless authentication.

Once a realm is selected in the Secure Access **Realm Management** section, administrators can create, view, and manage Secure Work identities, all without switching platforms.

### Current Limitations

At this time administrators cannot edit or delete a realm once it has been created.
