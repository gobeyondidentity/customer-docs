**Early Access**

## Overview

Administrators can create and manage Secure Customer Realms within the Secure Access Platform. Realms are distinct identity directories within a single tenant, each configurable to support customer passwordless authentication.

Once a realm is selected in the Secure Access **Realm Management** section, administrators can create, view, and manage Secure Customer identities, all without switching platforms.

<br/>

### Current Limitations

At this time administrators cannot edit or delete a realm once it has been created.

### Prerequisites ###

To create a Secure Customer Realm, your Beyond Identity Sales or Sales Engineering contact must have selected the **Secure Customer** realm type during initial tenant setup, if not, the **Realm Management** section will not appear in the Secure Access Admin Console.

**Note**: During the Early Access period, you’ll need to contact our Support Team to have this feature enabled in your navigation menu.
