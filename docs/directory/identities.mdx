## Manage Users and Passkeys
Before your users can use Beyond Identity or obtain a passkey, they need to be added as an identity to the Beyond Identity tenant so they can access applications.

An identity is a unique identifier and an end-user may have multiple identities. Identities can also be part of a group or belong to many groups. Groups are commonly used as a predicate in a policy rule (e.g. Allow group "Beyond Identity Administrators" to access the "Beyond Identity Admin console" application).

You can add users by: 

- Uploading a .csv file in the Admin console
- Manually adding them in the Admin console
- Using the Beyond Identity APIs
- Using SCIM

## Manage Users
