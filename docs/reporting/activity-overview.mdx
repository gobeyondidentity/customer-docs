# Overview

This section in your Beyond Identity Console contains all logs of actions from your organization. This information includes operational activity from across all directory models, policies, integrations, and access control configurations. All events are timestamped, tracked with unique identification, and referenced to specific policy versions and users. 

:::note
Log activity is stored for 90 days. To retain logs for longer, view the SIEM integration guides.

- `User` - Principal actor of the event
- `Country` - Location of the event
- `Correlation ID` - Identifier for two or more events related to each other
