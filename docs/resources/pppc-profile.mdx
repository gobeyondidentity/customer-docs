## Overview

Managing mobile devices in your organization requires balancing security requirements with user experience. This guide explains how to configure mobile device management (MDM) settings to create a seamless experience for your end users while maintaining security standards.

End users may experience friction when using security tools on mobile devices. The list below covers common difficulties and issues. These interruptions can confuse users and impact productivity.

- Multiple permission prompts
- Manual configuration requirements
- Repetitive authentication requests
- Disk access authorization prompts

The guide below covers steps to automate device configuration through a general MDM. This reduces user intervention, sets consistent security settings across devices, minimizes support requests, and increases user adoption of security tools.

## Steps

Follow the generalized instructions below for your MDM settings during deployment.

1. Set **identifier type** to `path`.
2. Input in **identifier field** the following value: `/Applications/Beyond Identity.app/Contents/Resources/osqueryi`.
3. Set the **code requirement** to the sample below.
```
anchor apple generic and identifier osqueryi and (certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.9] /* exists */ or certificate 1[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.6] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = BZA6SZ8XVQ)
```
