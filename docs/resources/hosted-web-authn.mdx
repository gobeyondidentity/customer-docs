# Web Authentication

## About Web Authentication

Web Authentication uses an entirely browser-based authenticator, which works
in the same was as the Beyond Identity Platform Authenticator on the device.

Web Authentication is a convenient solution for platforms where a
Platform Authenticator cannot be installed or has no access to underlying
system resources.

### Security Considerations

Beyond Identity supports two configurations of browser-based passkeys,
WebAuthn passkeys and software passkeys. 

> Blurb about webauthn

If your browser does not support WebAuthn, then Beyond Identity generates a software passkey.

### WebAuthn Passkeys

* WebAuthn passkeys are hardware based. 
* WebAuthn passkeys are bound to the domain on which they are created. This means they cannot be used to authenticate into a site on a different domain.
* Beyond Identity's WebAuthn passkeys cannot be synced between devices. 

### Software passkeys

* Software passkeys cannot be easily exfiltrated.
* Software passkeys do not support user verification.

## Configuring Web Authentication

For Secure Work:

1. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Tenant** and scroll down to **Authentication Options**.
2. Click the **Edit** icon.
3. Enable **Web Authentication**.
4. Select the platform or platforms on which to enable Web Authentication.

:::note
Enabling Web Authentication on a platform effectively disables the Platform Authenticator for that platform.

### Web Authentication and roaming

If Web Authentication and Roaming Authentication are enabled  a
user has no passkeys registered for that specific browser, then during an
authentication a roaming QR code will be displayed so that the user may proceed.

See Roaming Authentication for more details.


## Registering a passkey

Registering a passkey for web authenticator is the same process as registering a passkey in the Platform Authenticator. Click on the **Register New Passkey** button in the enrollment email. Your passkey will be registered with your default browser.

To register a passkey in a browser other than your default, copy the link fom the **Register New Passkey** in the enrollment email, then paste it into the navigation bar of the browser of your choice. 

After a passkey is registered with a browser, it is only be available in that browser. If you switch browsers, you cannot authenticate in a browser that does not have the registered passkey.
