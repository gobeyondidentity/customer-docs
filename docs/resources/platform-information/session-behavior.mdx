# Secure Access Console - Session Behavior

The Secure Access Console controls access to its resources through usage of a session. A session is tied to a user and is created after the user authenticates and logs into the Secure Access Console. The session ends when it expires after a set time or the user logs out. In addition, when a session inactivity timeout is set, the user is logged out after a set period of inactivity.

When a user is logged out of the Secure Access Console due to session expiration or inactivity timeout, they must re-authenticate to regain access to the application.

Session duration and inactivity timeout for the Secure Access Console are set to the following values:

|                       | **Privileged users¹** | **Non-privileged users²** |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Session duration³** | 24 hours              | 24 hours                   |
| **Session inactivity timeout⁴** | 15 minutes             | None                       |

¹ *Privileged users are users that are granted scopes. They belong to roles that give them access to read or write sensitive data. These users can access both the Secure Access Admin Console and Dashboard.*

² *Non-privileged users are users with no scopes. They either have no role or have been assigned to a role that has no scopes. These users can only access the Secure Access Dashboard.*

³ *Session duration - Amount of time before a session expires.*

⁴ *Session inactivity timeout - Amount of time the user is allowed to be inactive for before they are logged out.*

## Session Termination Due to Administrative Changes

In addition to standard timeouts, active sessions are also terminated when a user experiences administrative changes that revoke their access privileges.

The following administrative actions result in immediate logout:

- The user is suspended.
- The user loses access to a role that grants scopes (privileged access).

This can happen under the following scenarios:

### If the user was directly assigned to the role:
- The user is unassigned from the role.
- Scopes are removed from the role.
- The role is deleted.

### If the user belonged to a group assigned to the role:
- The user is removed from the group.
- The group is unassigned from the role.
- The group is deleted.
- Scopes are removed from the role.
- The role is deleted.

After any of these changes, the user must re-authenticate and will only regain access if they are assigned to a role with the appropriate scopes.
