## Deployment Prerequisites  
Before deploying the Beyond Identity Authenticator at scale, administrators must ensure that endpoint security tools, firewalls, and device policies allow the app to run without interference. 

### Allow-Listed Processes (Windows and macOS)  
The following processes should be allow-listed in endpoint detection and antivirus tools:  
- `BeyondIdentity.exe` (Windows)  
- `BeyondIdentityViewHelper.exe` (Windows)  
- `BIService.exe` (Windows)  
- `Beyond Identity.app` (macOS)  
- `com.beyondidentity.*` background services (macOS)   

### Code Signing and Team Identifiers  
To validate software integrity, ensure these identifiers are recognized:  
- macOS Team ID: `BZA6SZ8XVQ`  
- Windows Publisher: `Beyond Identity, Inc.` 

### Network Requirements  
The Authenticator must be able to reach Beyond Identity’s cloud endpoints. Ensure the following domains and subdomains are allow-listed in firewalls and proxies:  
- `*.beyondidentity.com`  
- `*.byndid.com`  

### Security Tool Compatibility  
Some endpoint security agents may require exclusions for Beyond Identity processes to prevent interference with authentication flows. Consult your EDR/AV documentation for configuring exceptions.
