# Operating system version support

Beyond Identity is not providing ongoing support for the  Platform Authenticator on operating systems the OS vendor has declared `End of Life`. Newer versions of the Platform Authenticator are not tested on unsupported operating systems. 

:::note
This policy is active on March 1st, 2025.
:::

As part of our [Secure by Design commitment](https://www.beyondidentity.com/our-difference/secure-by-design), we only support operating systems with ongoing security updates. The following points are impacts to customers.

- Users update to supported operating systems
- The Platform Authenticator may continue to operate on unsupported operating systems

Updating the operating system to a newer version supported by the OS vendor ensures the Platform Authenticator continues to operate as expected.

:::note
Secure Access Platform customers can contact their CSM or Support team for guidance.
