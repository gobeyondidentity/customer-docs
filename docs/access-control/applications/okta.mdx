4. On the dropdown field below, select **Any IP**.  
5. Click **Create token**.  
6. Copy the token value and store it in a secure location. Click **OK, got it** to continue.

### ðŸŸ  Okta: Set up custom attribute for users

The section here is for setting up a custom attribute for users in Okta. This value acts as a flag for users signing in to Okta to be directed to the Beyond Identity sign on process. When the integration is complete, the phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication from Beyond Identity serves as the security between the user and the resources.

When the user creates a Beyond Identity passkey, the cloud service sets the `byndidRegistered` value to `true` in the Okta user's profile. This indicates the user has a Beyond Identity passkey. The boolean value set to true is the flag for the Beyond Identity process in the login.

1. On the Okta platform, navigate to **Directory** â†’ **Profile editor**.  
2. Select the **User (default)** profile under the Okta type.  
3. Scroll to the **Attributes** section.  
4. Click **+ Add attribute**.  
5. For the attribute, select the following and input or select the values in the associated fields.  
   1. **Data type** â†’ **Boolean**  
   2. **Display name** â†’ `Beyond Identity Registration Status`  
   3. **Variable name** â†’ `byndidRegistered`  
   4. **User permission** â†’ select **Read only**  
6. Click **Save**.

### ðŸ”µ Beyond Identity: Configure Okta domain

This section is for configuring the Okta credentials and values within Beyond Identity to complete the single sign-on setup. With these fields configured, Okta can then route users to Beyond Identity for phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. The steps below are for the Beyond Identity console.

1. On the new Okta app in Beyond Identity, navigate to the **Configure registration attribute for users in Okta** section.  
2. Input the following information into the respective fields.  
   1. Okta Domain â†’ the Okta domain URL value from your Okta account   
   2. Okta Token â†’ the Okta token from Step 6 of ðŸŸ  [Okta: Create Okta API token](#-okta-create-okta-api-token)
3. Click **Save changes** at the top of the page.  
4. Scroll down to the **Client Information & Endpoints** section for values to copy to Okta.

## Stage IV

In this stage of the integration, the Okta platform requires the new identity provider of Beyond Identity to get configured. The sections below also include using routing rules for Beyond Identity to serve as the identity provider when logging into Okta resources.

After Okta has the Beyond Identity identity provider set up, the groups in Beyond Identity must be assigned to the new Okta app within the console. This completes the process to use Beyond Identity as the phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication flow for users.

### ðŸŸ  Okta: Configure new identity provider

This section is for setting up Beyond Identity as a new identity provider in Okta. These steps require values from Beyond Identity to enable the phishing-resistant multifactor authentication flow.
