# Steps

Follow the steps in the sections below to complete your integration for Beyond Identity and Okta.

## Legend

The sections below use these two color codings to identify the steps for separate platforms.

ðŸ”µ Beyond Identity: Beyond Identity platform tasks are highlighted in blue.
ðŸŸ  Okta: Okta platform tasks are highlighted in orange.

## Stage I

The sections here are for the initial setup between Beyond Identity and Okta. This is for setting up the Okta Application in the Beyond Identity Console and for creating groups in Okta for Beyond Identity. This group is  a subset of your users that use Beyond Identity for authentication instead of any current authentication methods.

### ðŸ”µ Beyond Identity: Set up Okta application in Console

The steps in this section are for going through the initial Beyond Identity configuration. This covers adding the Okta integration application in the Beyond Identity Console.

1. Navigate to your Beyond Identity console.
2. On the left-hand navigation under **Access Control**, click **Applications**.
3. Select the **Browse Applications** tab.
4. Click **Okta** to proceed.
5. Click **Add OIDC**.
6. Under **General** â†’ **Display Name**, input `Okta` into the text field.
7. Keep the app open for values to add to Okta later.

### ðŸŸ  Okta: Set up Beyond Identity group

This section covers creating a Beyond Identity group in your Okta environment. This is the subset of users to use Beyond Identity phishing-resistant authentication to authenticate into Okta.

1. On your Okta home page, navigate to **Directory** â†’ **Groups** on the left hand side.
2. Click the **Add Group** button.
3. In the **Name** field, input `Beyond Identity`. Description is optional.
4. Click **Save**. This returns you to the **Groups** page.
5. Click the **Beyond Identity** group.
6. Click the **Assign people** button to assign users with the **+** icon to the **Beyond Identity** group.
7. Click **Done** to return to the **Groups** page.

## Stage II

The Stage II sections cover the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) implementation between Beyond Identity as the inbound platform and Okta as the outbound platform.

SCIM is used to populate users from your Okta directory to the Beyond Identity directory. The SCIM protocol automatically updates any changes in your Okta directory to the Beyond Identity directory.

:::note
With the SCIM implementation, this means the Okta directory is the source of truth. Any changes made to your Okta directory are pushed and reflected in the Beyond Identity directory.
:::

### ðŸŸ  Okta: Create outbound SCIM app

To have Okta act as the outbound SCIM provider, follow the steps below. All the steps in this process happen within the Okta platform.

1. Navigate to **Applications** â†’ **Applications** on the left hand side.
2. Click the **Browse App catalog** button.
3. In the search field, input `SCIM 2.0 Test App (OAuth Bearer Token)` to select the correct app.
4. On the `SCIM 2.0 Test App (OAuth Bearer Token)` page, click **Add integration**.
5. In the Application label field, update the text to `Beyond Identity Outbound SCIM`.
6. For the **General settingsÂ· Required** page, the default values are valid. Click **Next**.
7. For the **Sign-On OptionsÂ· Required** page, the default values are valid as well. Click **Done** at the bottom of the page.

After this section, return to the Beyond Identity Console to copy values for this SCIM configuration.

### ðŸ”µ Beyond Identity: Create API token for inbound SCIM

This section is for configuring Okta as an inbound SCIM provider for your Beyond Identity directory. Follow the steps below in your Beyond Identity  Console.

1. In the Okta app in Beyond Identity you created in Stage I, navigate to the **Bearer tokens** section.
2. Click **Add bearer token**.
3. Input a name for the bearer token such as `Okta SCIM Token`.
4. Select an expiration date for the token.  The default value is valid.
5. Copy the value and store in a secure location.
6. Scroll to the **Configure inbound provisioning** section.
7. Copy the **SCIM URL** value, for example `https://api-us.beyondidentity.com/v1/.../scim/v2`.

:::note
The Beyond Identity bearer token for the inbound SCIM has an expiration date. To continue with the SCIM implementation, the token must be updated after the initial token expires.<br></br><br></br>Okta does not support SCIM with `client credentials`. This is a service-to-service authentication protocol that automatically refreshes the tokens. <br></br><br></br>Adding `Basic Authentication` to our SCIM implementation and not having to update the token after expiration is coming at a later time.
:::

### ðŸŸ  Okta: Update provisioning for SCIM

After completing the Beyond Identity section for copying the SCIM URL and Bearer token values, this section goes over testing the credentials within Okta to prepare for SCIM. These steps are from your Okta Admin Console.

1. In your **Beyond Identity Outbound SCIM** application you created earlier, navigate to the **Provisioning** tab.
2. Click the **Configure API Integration** button.
3. Check the **Enable API integration** box.
4. From the [Beyond Identity: Create API token for inbound SCIM](#-beyond-identity-create-api-token-for-inbound-scim) section, copy and input the following values into Okta.
   - **SCIM URL** â†’  **SCIM 2.0 Base Url**
   - **Bearer token** â†’ **OAuth Bearer Token**
5. Click **Test API Credentials**.
   - Click **Save** if the test is successful.
   - If the test is not successful, return to the [Beyond Identity: Create API token for inbound SCIM](#-beyond-identity-create-api-token-for-inbound-scim) section above and repeat the steps.

### ðŸŸ  Okta: Continue SCIM app setup

When the API credentials are configured, this means Okta can now begin provisioning users from your Okta directory to the Beyond Identity directory. Follow the steps below to finish your SCIM app setup in Okta.

When this step is completed, the **Beyond Identity** group created in [Okta: Set up Beyond Identity group](#-okta-set-up-beyond-identity-group) is synced to your Beyond Identity directory.

1. On the **SCIM Beyond Identity Application** page, navigate to **Provisioning** â†’ **To App** â†’ **Provisioning to App** section.
2. Click **Edit.**
3. Check the following boxes.
   1. **Create Users**
   2. **Update User Attributes**
   3. **Deactivate users**
4. Click **Save**.
5. Navigate to **Assignments** â†’ Click **Assign** drop down â†’ Select **Assign to Groups**.
6. Select **Assign** for **Beyond Identity** group.
7. Click **Save and Go Back**.
8. Click **Done**.

### ðŸŸ  Okta: Push SCIM users

With the configuration complete for the inbound and outbound SCIM implementation, the app must push users to Beyond Identity. Begin this process with the steps below.

1. On the **Beyond Identity Outbound SCIM** Application page, navigate to **Push Groups** tab.
2. Click **Push Groups** dropdown.
3. Select **Find groups by name**.
4. Search for **Beyond Identity** group.
   - *NOTE*: The Okta directory cannot have a group with the same name existing in the Beyond Identity directory. Group name collisions result in an error.
5. Click **Save**. This prompts the SCIM process to begin in Okta to push the group to Beyond Identity.

:::note
Check the identities and groups in the Beyond Identity Console to confirm the SCIM setup and application success. Updates may take time. If the SCIM setup hasn't completed, check your SCIM application configuration.
:::

## Stage III


This section involves setting up a callback hook into your Okta directory to update an attribute on users in your Okta directory. This value communicates that the user has registered a Beyond Identity passkey. This attribute is necessary in Stage IV, [Okta: Create routing rules](#-okta-create-routing-rules) to route your users to use Beyond Identity to authenticate into Okta rather than your existing authentication methods.

### ðŸŸ  Okta: Create Okta API token

The steps below are for the Okta platform. This section guides you through creating an API token to use within Beyond Identity.

1. On the Okta platform, navigate to **Security** â†’ **API** â†’ click the **Tokens** tab.
2. Click the **Create token** button.
3. Input a name for the token in the first field.
4. On the dropdown field below, select **Any IP**.
5. Click **Create token**.
6. Name the token **Beyond Identity API Token**.
7. API Calls made with this token must originate from **Any IP**. This can be changed later.
8. Copy the token value and store it in a secure location. Click **OK, got it** to continue.

### ðŸŸ  Okta: Set up custom attribute for users

The section here is for setting up a custom attribute for users in Okta. This value acts as a flag for users signing in to Okta to be directed to the Beyond Identity sign on process.

When the user registers a Beyond Identity passkey, the cloud service sets the `byndidRegistered` value to `true` in the Okta user's profile. This indicates the user has a Beyond Identity passkey. It is used for the routing rule to direct users to use Beyond Identity authentication during login.

1. On the Okta platform, navigate to **Directory** â†’ **Profile editor**.
2. Select the **User (default)** profile under the Okta type.
3. Scroll to the **Attributes** section.
4. Click **+ Add attribute**.
5. For the attribute, select the following and input or select the values in the associated fields.
   1. **Data type** â†’ **Boolean**
   2. **Display name** â†’ `Beyond Identity Registration Status`
   3. **Variable name** â†’ `byndidRegistered`
   4. **User permission** â†’ select **Read only**
6. Click **Save**.

### ðŸ”µ Beyond Identity: Configure Okta domain and set up API Access

This section guides you through configuring the Okta token created in the previous step to set an attribute in your Okta directory, indicating that the user is registered with Beyond Identity. This attribute is also used in the [Okta: Create routing rules](#-okta-create-routing-rules) section to route users through Beyond Identity for authentication.

1. On the new Okta app in Beyond Identity, navigate to the **Configure registration attribute for users in Okta** section.
2. Input the following information into the respective fields.
   - Okta Domain â†’ the Okta domain URL value from your Okta account<br></br>*NOTE:* This value must resolve to the full URL and omit the `-admin` suffix, for example `https://dev-48007952.okta.com`.
   - Okta Token â†’ the Okta token from Step 6 of ðŸŸ  [Okta: Create Okta API token](#-okta-create-okta-api-token)
3. Click **Save changes** at the top of the page.
4. Scroll down to the **Client Information & Endpoints** section for values to copy to Okta.

## Stage IV

In this stage of the integration, the Okta platform requires the new identity provider of Beyond Identity to get configured. The sections below also include using routing rules for Beyond Identity to serve as the identity provider when logging into Okta resources.

After Okta has the Beyond Identity identity provider set up, the users and groups in Beyond Identity must be assigned to the new Okta app within the console. This completes the process to use Beyond Identity as the phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication flow for users.

### ðŸŸ  Okta: Configure new identity provider

This section is for setting up Beyond Identity as a new identity provider in Okta. These steps require values from Beyond Identity to enable the phishing-resistant multifactor authentication flow.

:::note
