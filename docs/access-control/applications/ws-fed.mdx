## Overview

This guide is for delegating authentication to Beyond Identity for your Entra environment through WS-Fed.
Integrating Beyond Identity with your Entra environment through WS-Fed allows your users to authenticate with Beyond Identity, a passwordless, phishing-resistant, multi-factor authentication solution.

This guide covers the steps required to complete the integration.

## Stage summary

The integration setup consists of the five stages below. Each stage covers the initial set up for continuing the integration process on each respective platform. Follow the guide in linear order to complete the integration.

  - **Recommended, optional*

# Steps

Follow the steps in the sections below to complete your integration for Beyond Identity and Microsoft Entra ID.

## Legend

The sections below use these two color codings to identify the steps for separate platforms. Use a separate browser window when following instructions for each platform.

ðŸ”µ **Beyond Identity** - Beyond Identity platform tasks are highlighted in blue.

ðŸŸ  **Microsoft Entra ID** - Microsoft Entra ID platform and Powershell tasks are highlighted in orange.

## Stage I

The sections here are for the initial setup between Beyond Identity and Microsoft Entra ID.
This is for setting up the WS-Fed application in the Beyond Identity Console. Optionally, you can set
up a Beyond Identity Group in your Entra ID instance.

### ðŸŸ  (Optional) Set up Beyond Identity Group in Entra ID

This section explains how to set up a Beyond Identity group in your Entra ID instance. While having a Beyond Identity group containing all your Beyond Identity users can be useful later in this guide, it is optional.

1. Navigate to your Entra ID Admin Console at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID**.
1. On the left-hand navigation, click **Manage** â†’ **Groups**.
1. Click **+ New group**.
1. For the **Group name** field, input `Beyond Identity Users`.
1. For the **Group description** field, input `Beyond Identity Users Group`.
1. Under **Members**, click **No members selected**.
1. Search for the users that you want to add to the group.
1. Select the users and click **Select**.
1. Click **Create**.


### ðŸ”µ Set up WS-Fed application in Beyond Identity

The following section covers setting up a WS-Fed application in the Beyond Identity console. This WS-Fed application is the configuration
on the Beyond Identity side for delegating authentication to Beyond Identity.

1. Navigate to your Beyond Identity Admin Console.
1. On the left-hand navigation under **Access Control**, click **Applications**.
1. Select the **Browse Applications** tab.
1. Click the **WS-Fed** tile to proceed.
1. Click **Add WS-FED**.
1. Under **General** â†’ **Display Name**, input `Microsoft Entra ID` into the text field.
1. Under the **Configuration** section, input the following information into the respective fields.
    - **ACS URL (SSO URL)*** - `https://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf`
    - **Audience URL (Entity ID)*** - `urn:federation:MicrosoftOnline`
1. For the **Subject User Name Attribute** field, select **External ID** in the dropdown.
    - This field is the value that is present in the WS-Fed token after Beyond Identity authenticates the user.
    This is how Entra matches the Beyond Identity user to the user in Entra.
1. For the **Attribute Statements (Optional)** section, use the table below to input the additional four attributes.
These are additional attributes sent in the WS-Fed token to Entra during the authentication process.

| Service Provider Attribute Name | Name Format | Beyond Identity Attribute Name | Namespace |
|---|---|---|---|
| `immutableID` | unspecified | External ID | `http://schemas.microsoft.com/LiveID/Federation/2008/05` |
| `emailaddress` | unspecified | Email | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress` |
| `UPN` | unspecified | Username | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims` |
| `authnmethodsreferences` | unspecified | Custom static string `http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/multipleauthn` | `http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims` |

10. Click **Save Changes** at the top of the page.

## Stage II

The Stage II sections cover the System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) implementation between Beyond Identity as the inbound platform and Microsoft Entra ID as the outbound platform.
SCIM is used to populate users from your Microsoft Entra ID directory to the Beyond Identity directory.
The SCIM protocol automatically updates any changes in your Microsoft Entra ID directory to the Beyond Identity directory.

:::note
With the SCIM implementation, the Entra ID directory is the source of truth. Any changes made to the Entra ID directory are reflected in the Beyond Identity directory.
:::


### ðŸŸ  Create SCIM application in Microsoft Entra ID

This section includes steps for creating a SCIM application in Microsoft Entra ID. This SCIM application provisions users to Beyond Identity.

1. Navigate to your Microsoft Entra ID Admin Console at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID**.
1. On the left-hand navigation, click **Manage** â†’ **Enterprise applications**.
1. Click **+ New application**.
1. Click **+ Create your own application**.
1. For field **What's the name of your app?**, input `Beyond Identity SCIM`.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Under the **Getting Started** section, click **1. Assign users and groups**.
1. Click **+ Add user/group**.
1. On the left-hand navigation, under **Users and groups**, click **None Selected**.
1. Select the users and groups for using Beyond Identity authentication. This includes all the users in the domain that you later federate.
1. After selecting the users and groups, click **Assign** at the bottom of the page.
1. Now, on the left-hand navigation, click **Manage** â†’ **Provisioning**.
1. This shows a preview of the application. On the left-hand navigation, click **Manage** â†’ **Provisioning**.
1. For the **Provisioning Mode**, set to **Automatic**.
1. The new section, **Admin Credentials** appears.
1. Return to the Beyond Identity console to get the SCIM credentials to input into the **Admin Credentials** section.


### ðŸ”µ Set up SCIM application in Beyond Identity

This section is for getting the SCIM credentials from Beyond Identity to enter into the Entra ID SCIM application you just created.
This step enables Entra ID to push users and groups from your Entra ID directory into your Beyond Identity directory.

1. Navigate to your Beyond Identity Admin Console.
1. On the left-hand navigation, click **Access Control** â†’ **Applications**.
1. Select the **Browse Applications** tab.
1. Click the **SCIM** tile to proceed.
1. Click **Add SCIM**.
1. Under **General** â†’ **Display Name**, input `Microsoft Entra ID SCIM` into the text field.
1. Under the **Configure inbound provisioning section**, obtain the following values and store for user later.
   - **SCIM URL**
   - An API Bearer token you generate in the next step.
1. To generate the API Bearer token, go to the **Bearer tokens** section and click the **Add Bearer Token** button.
1. For the **Name** field, input `Microsoft Entra ID SCIM Token`. Leave the expiration field as the default value.
1. Click **Add token**.
1. Copy the value and store in a secure location.
1. Click **Save Changes** at the top of the page.

:::note
The Beyond Identity bearer token for the inbound SCIM has an expiration date. To ensure the SCIM implementation doesn't break, the token must be updated after the initial token expires.
<br></br><br></br>
Entra ID does not support SCIM with `client credentials`, which is a service-to-service authentication protocol that automatically refreshes the tokens. We will look into alternative solutions to ensure that you don't have to manually update the token from time to time.
:::

### ðŸŸ  Enter SCIM credentials in Microsoft Entra ID

1. Navigate back to your SCIM application that you created in [Create SCIM application in Microsoft Entra ID section](#-create-scim-application-in-microsoft-entra-id).
1. Under **Admin Credentials**, input the following values.
   - `Tenant URL`: the value of `SCIM URL` from the section above.
   - `Secret Token`: the Bearer token that you created from the section above.
1. Click **Test Connection**.
   1. If the test connection is successful, click **Save**.
   1. If the test connection is unsuccessful, go back to the [Set up SCIM application in Beyond Identity section](#-set-up-scim-application-in-beyond-identity) and ensure the correct values were copied over.
1. Click **Save**.
1. The new section, **Mappings**, appears.

### ðŸŸ  Update Attribute Mappings for SCIM in Microsoft Entra ID

This section covers the attribute mappings for the SCIM application in Microsoft Entra ID.
This ensures that your Entra ID user and group attributes maps correctly to the Beyond Identity user and group attributes.

#### Provision Microsoft Entra ID Groups

1. Under the **Mappings** section, click **Provision Microsoft Entra ID Groups**.
1. Under the **Attribute Mapping** section, there should be a **customappsso Attribute** called **externalId**.
1. In that row, click the **Delete** button.

:::note
In the Beyond Identity SCIM implementation for groups, we do not support this field.
:::

#### Provision Microsoft Entra ID Users

1. Under the **Mappings** section, click **Provision Microsoft Entra ID Users**.
1. At the bottom of the **Attribute Mapping** section, click **Show advanced options** checkbox.
1. Click **Edit attribute list for customappsso**.
1. Mark the following attributes as required:
   - **id**
   - **displayName**
   - **userName**
   - **externalId**
1. At the bottom, add the following attribute.

    | Name | Type |
    |---|---|
    | `emails[primary eq true].value` | String |

1. Click **Save**.
1. Under the **Attribute Mappings** section, click **Add New Mapping**.
1. Apply the following configurations. All other fields are valid defaults.
   - **Source attribute**: `mail`
   - **Target attribute**: `emails[primary eq true].value`
1. Click **Save**.

:::note
In the SCIM specifications, users have two types of emails, the `primary` email and `work` email. This setup confirms the correct email selection in the configuration.
The default Entra ID SCIM configuration maps the user's email into the `work` email. The `work` email isn't currently supported in Beyond Identity. The custom mapping for Beyond Identity uses the supported `primary` email instead.
:::


10. Under the **Attribute Mappings** list, find the `externalId` attribute.
1. In that row, click the `Edit` button.
1. For the **Source attribute** field, select `immutableId`.
1. Click **Save**.
:::note
This process confirms the `immutableId` is set as the `External ID` field in Beyond Identity when Entra ID populates the Beyond Identity directory.
This unique value allows identity matching of your Entra ID and Beyond Identity directories.
:::

13. Click **Save** at the top of the page to save all changes to **Attribute Mapping**.
<br></br>The next section covers provisioning users from your Entra ID directory to the Beyond Identity directory.

### ðŸŸ  Provision users in Beyond Identity using the Entra ID SCIM application

This section includes steps to provision users from your Entra ID directory to the Beyond Identity directory.

1. Navigate back to your SCIM application in Entra ID.
1. Navigate to the **Overview** section.
1. Click **Start Provisioning**.

:::note
This process may take up to 30 minutes to complete.
Entra ID also pushes changes to the Beyond Identity directory using SCIM on a fixed interval. This typically happens on a 40 minute schedule.
:::

4. After this process is complete, return to your Beyond Identity Console.
5. Click on **Identities** and you should see all your users populated!


## Stage III

This section outlines the user enrollment process. It includes assigning users to the Beyond Identity application and confirming they register a passkey on their device or devices.

Completing this step is mandatory before federating the domain. This is because domain federation in Entra ID is a comprehensive action and can't be portioned or split otherwise for authentication. In this case, all users must have Beyond Identity assigned as the application and have a registered passkey on their device.

When authentication is switched to Beyond Identity, users must have a Beyond Identity passkey to log in successfully. All users without a Beyond Identity passkey are locked out from logging in.

:::tip
Prevent any disruptions to your organization and confirm all users register a passkey on their device before proceeding with domain federation in Stage IV.
:::

### ðŸ”µ Assign application to users

In this section, we will assign your users the WS-Fed application that we created in [Stage I](#stage-i). This ensures that when they login to Entra ID with their passkey, they successfully authenticate with Beyond Identity.

1. Navigate to your Beyond Identity Admin Console.
1. On the left-hand navigation, click **Access Control** â†’ **Applications**.
1. Go to your **Microsoft Entra ID** WS-Fed application that you created in [Stage I](#stage-i).
1. Click the **Assignments** tab at the top.
1. Click the **Add Assignments** drop down.
1. Add the users and groups that are authenticating via Beyond Identity (this should be ALL your users).
1. Click **Save Changes** at the top of the page once completed.

### ðŸ”µ Create Entra ID Bookmark App

In this section, we will set up a **Bookmark App**. When your users complete the enrollment process, they are redirected to the Beyond Identity dashboard. To prevent user confusion, we will put an app tile that redirects the user to the Azure Portal.

1. Navigate to your Beyond Identity Admin Console.
1. On the left-hand navigation, click **Access Control** â†’ **Applications**.
1. Select the **Browse Applications** tab.
1. Click on the **Bookmark** tile.

   1. **Login Link**: `https://myapps.microsoft.com`
   1. **App Tile**: Upload an Azure Icon.
1. Click **Save Changes** at the top.
1. Navigate to the **Assignments** tab at the top.
1. Click the **Add Assignments** drop down.
1. Add the users and groups that are authenticating via Beyond Identity (this should be ALL your users).
1. Click **Save Changes** at the top.


### ðŸ”µ Enroll users with passkeys

In this section, we will get your end users set up with a passkey on their device. All your users MUST have a passkey registered on their device(s) before federating the domain, or they will be locked out.

#### Bulk Enrollment

1. On the Beyond Identity console, navigate to **Identities**.
1. Use the **Enrollment status** filter to filter by enrollment status. Enrollment status can be one of the following values:
   - **Unenrolled**: The identity does not have any pending invites or any active passkeys.
   - **Pending**: The identity has one or more pending invites and no active passkeys.
   - **Enrolled**: The identity has one or more active passkeys.
1. After filtering, you can multi-select users that you want to send an enrollment email to.
1. Click the **Add passkey(s)** button above the identities table. A **Send enrollment** modal should appear.
1. Under Identity Verification Method, select **Magic link**.
   1. For the **Send email** option, the email connected to that identity receives a Beyond Identity welcome email for the process to register a passkey.
1. When the user goes through the enrollment process, they will go through an interactive guide with the following 2 steps:
   1. Download the Beyond Identity Platform Authenticator - this is the app that is required for Beyond Identity authentication.
   1. Enroll a passkey on their device.

#### Single identity enrollment

1. On the Beyond Identity console, navigate to **Identities** â†’ a specific user â†’ **Passkeys** tab.
1. The following options are avaialable for adding a passkey for an identity:
   1. If an identity does not have any active passkeys, click the **Add a passkey** button in the middle.
   1. If an identity has one or more active passkeys, click the **Actions** button â†’ **Add passkey**.
1. Under Identity Verification Method, select **Magic link**.
1. For the Delivery Method option, select **Send email** or **Generate link.**
1. Click the **Send enrollment** button.
   1. For the **Send email** option, the email connected to that identity receives a Beyond Identity welcome email for the process to register a passkey.
   1. For the **Generate link** option, a URL is generated from Beyond Identity. This link is for sharing with the user for them to register a passkey.
1. When the user goes through the enrollment process, they will go through an interactive guide with the following 2 steps:
   1. Download the Beyond Identity Platform Authenticator - this is the app that is required for Beyond Identity authentication.
   1. Enroll a passkey on their device.

:::note
Ensure all your users have enrolled in passkeys before proceeding with the next step.
:::

## Stage IV Domain Federation

In this step, we will federate your Azure domain to use Beyond Identity authentication.

:::danger
Ensure all your users have enrolled in passkeys before proceeding with the next step. Domain federation in Entra ID is an **all-or-nothing operation** when it comes to authentication. If any users do not have passkeys, they will be locked out.
:::


### ðŸ”µ Get Powershell Script from WS-Fed Application

We have a generated Powershell script for you to run!

1. Navigate to your Beyond Identity Admin Console.
1. On the left-hand navigation, click **Access Control** â†’ **Applications**.
1. Go to your **Microsoft Entra ID** WS-Fed application that you created in [Stage I](#stage-i).
1. Under **Configuration**, click the **View Federation Script** button.
1. Enter in the following values:
   - **Domain Name**: Your domain name that you want federated. It should not have a leading period. Ex. `beyondidentity.com`.
   - **Logoff Url**: You can set a logoff URL, or leave it as the default value.
1. Download or copy the script. You will need it in the next step.

### ðŸŸ  Executing Powershell Script for Domain Federation

These steps are for executing the script in Powershell to federate the domain.

1. In your Powershell environment, ensure you have the proper [Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation?view=graph-powershell-1.0) installed. In your Powershell environment, run the following command:

   ```
   Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force
   ```

2. Verify your installation by running the following command:
   ```
   Get-InstalledModule Microsoft.Graph
   ```

   Ensure the following modules are installed:
   - `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication`
   - `Microsoft.Graph.Identity.DirectoryManagement`

   If they are not installed, run the following commands to install those SDKs directly:

   ```
   Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -Scope CurrentUser -Force
   Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Identity.DirectoryManagement -Scope CurrentUser -Force
   ```

:::caution
Ensure the versions of Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK are 2.26.1 or higher. There was a bug in the 2.26.0 version that causes the domain federation to fail.
:::

3. Run the script from the step above.
1. For the Security warning pop up, click **Run once**.
1. The browser window appears for the log in to Microsoft. Continue to pick your account for the login.
1. The domain is federated after logging in. According to Microsoft, domain federation can take up to 60 Minutes.

## Stage V

This outlines the process for adding new users to your Entra ID environment.

### ðŸŸ  Update ImmutableID for Azure Users

If your organization is running in an **Azure AD Only** deployment, you must set the `immutableID` for the users in your Entra ID directory. This ensures that the users are properly mapped in the Beyond Identity directory. Users created in an **Azure AD Only** environment do not have this attribute populated.

1. Verify your Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK installation by running the following command:
   ```
   Get-InstalledModule Microsoft.Graph
   ```

   Ensure the following modules are installed:
   - `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication`
   - `Microsoft.Graph.Users`

   If they are not installed, run the following commands to install those SDKs directly:

   ```
   Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -Scope CurrentUser -Force
   Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Users -Scope CurrentUser -Force
   ```

2. Run the PowerShell script below to create new users and set the `immutableID` value for proper mapping. If you need further assistance, contact your Beyond Identity representative.

   ```
   # Connect to Microsoft Graph with necessary permissions
   Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "User.ReadWrite.All"

   # Define user UPN
   $upn = "<upn of the user you are setting ImmutableID for>"

   # Get user details
   Write-Output "Calling Get-MgUser"
   $user = Get-MgUser -UserId $upn
   Write-Output "User found: $($user.DisplayName)"

   # Generate ImmutableID from ObjectID
   $uuid = [system.convert]::ToBase64String(([GUID]$user.Id).ToByteArray())
   Write-Output "Generated ImmutableID: $uuid"

   # Update the user's ImmutableID
   Update-MgUser -UserId $upn -OnPremisesImmutableId $uuid
   Write-Output "ImmutableID updated successfully."
   ```

:::success
Congratulations! You've completed your Beyond Identity integration with Entra ID!
