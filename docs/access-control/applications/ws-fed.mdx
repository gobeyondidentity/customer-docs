## ðŸ”µðŸŸ  Federate the domain

4. The browser window appears for the log in to Microsoft. Continue to pick your account for the login.
5. Close the **Generate Federation Script** pop up. The domain is federated after logging in. According to Microsoft, domain federation can take up to 30 Minutes.

## ðŸŸ  SCIM Entra users to Beyond Identity

At this point in the guide, complete the process for bringing Entra users to Beyond Identity. Use the Entra platform to complete the SCIM to map users and attributes to Beyond Identity for the integration. The requirements below are for mapping attributes to add and modify.

On the **Attribute Mapping** page for **Provisioning** in Microsoft Entra, confirm the **customappsso Attributes** and corresponding **Microsoft Entra ID Attributes** configurations.

- `emails[primary eq true].value` -  set **Apply this mapping** to **Always**
- `emails[type eq "work"].value` - set **Apply this mapping** to **Only During Object Creation**
- `externalID` - `immutableId`

:::note
NOTE: Adding new users after federating the domain causes a `sourceanchor` issue in Entra. Contact your Beyond Identity representative for support.
