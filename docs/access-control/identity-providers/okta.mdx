This guide is designed to offer step-by-step instructions to integrate Beyond Identity with your Okta environment, and to enable your end users to authenticate with phishing resistant, passwordless authentication. Specifically, you will learn how to:

- Configure Beyond Identity as the primary phishing-resistant, passwordless authentication method for your Okta environment.
- Configure Okta to delegate authentication to Beyond Identity to enhance security and the user experience.

## Prerequisites

To ensure a smooth integration process, please confirm the availability of the following prerequisites and settings within your Okta account.

### Create an Okta Account

This guide assume you already have an Okta account provisioned. If you need to create one, [Click here](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).
