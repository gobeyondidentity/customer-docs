The Identity Providers (IdPs) functionality in Beyond Identity is for IT administrators to integrate existing Identity Providers into their authentication workflow. This configuration ensures that users verify their identity with an external IdP before they can enroll in a Beyond Identity credential. By leveraging your existing IdP for this step, Beyond Identity enhances your passwordless authentication deployment with an added layer of security and user verification.
