## Secure Access

Learn more about the latest updates to the Secure Access platform.

### April 3rd, 2025

<summary><p>Version 2.103.0 Endpoint Release Notes</p></summary>
## Credential enrollment for Secure Access
- We've launched functionality for the process of taking a trusted device with its passkey and extending the passkey to another device. End users enrolled in Beyond Identity can provision passkeys to their devices on their own. Learn more about credential enrollment in the guides below.
    - [Self Enrollment Guide for End Users]
    - [Credential Enrollment Policy Guide]

## Bug fixes

**Domain Connector**
- Fixed an issue where Domain Connector `2.102.6` would not start. 
- Changed default locations and settings to better align with Windows best practices.
    - Settings.ini file moved to `C:\ProgramData\BeyondIdentity\domain_connector.ini`
    - Default log folder moved to `C:\ProgramData\BeyondIdentity\logs\domainConnector`
    - The `multiDC` configuration value now defaults to `yes`
<br></br>
iOS & Android Platform Authenticator
- Default the initial screen to the listing of all user passkeys instead of the first passkey.
<br></br>
**macOS Authenticator**
- Fixed a minor issue where a long username would cause the Tenant name to be clipped on the user passkey.

### What's new

- New event type: Fetch Data From Integration
  - We are now publishing a new debug capability for integrations that improves event transparency and accountability in the Beyond Identity Console.
  - The new event type, `FETCH_DATA_FROM_INTEGRATION`, provides information when an attempt to retrieve data from your integrations fails.
  - Beyond Identity will retry the connection to your integration approximately once per 15 minutes. Each time the attempt to fetch data from the integration fails, you will see the new event in your Activity log.
  - After the connection to the integration is restored, we will send one `FETCH_DATA_FROM_INTEGRATION` event with a Success outcome to confirm that the connection has been reestablished. Future successful data retrievals will not send more events.
  - You can filter these events from your view in the Activity log.
<br></br>

### Bug fixes

- Resolved an issue to allow the SCIM server to accept string values for boolean attributes, improving the experience while integrating SCIM with Microsoft Entra ID, which provisions the `active` attribute as a string instead of a boolean.
- Fixed the Datadog SIEM integration configuration screen not displaying a required API Key field input when attempting to add the instance without the value.
- Resolved an issue that happens when manually adding an Identity then deleting values in the Add identity pop up. That behavior returned a `400` error and also caused the remaining user information to persist when attempting to create another new identity.
- Fixed inaccurate data for the Integrations activity log of the event's date and time recorded when comparing date values from the table on the Log page to the Activity page.
- Revised the language in the Policy Rules section of OS Version configurations. The description now reflects that the OS version rule applies to the last five updates of the current version of the operating system instead of the last five updates of the major version. This means updates do not cross versions, so for example the `14.x` version is not within any updates of a `15.x` version.
- Resolved an iOS issue that created a duplicate prompt during biometric authentication on trusted devices.
- Fixed a bug with Policy involving rules with geolocation comparison for event attributes not matching to users within that geolocation during policy outcome simulation.
- Fixed an API issue when attempting to add an identity to a non-existent group displaying an internal error of `500` instead of a `404` Not Found.
- Improved initialization of the Swift SDK against multi-thread initialization and also fixed an issue during initialization related to an inability to prevent the passkey directory from being backed up.

  <summary><p>Windows Version 2.102.0-6 and macOS 2.102.0-7 Endpoint Release Notes</p></summary>
  <p><ul>
  <h4>New</h4>
    <b>Platform Authenticator Proxy</b>
    <br></br>
    Beyond Identity is in the process of adding official proxy support to the Platform Authenticator on the macOS and Windows platforms. This is the first release to preview this functionality.
    <br></br>
    To minimize the chance of any change in behavior for existing users of Beyond Identity, this feature is not active by default. However, during the preview phase of this feature, the end user of the Platform Authenticator can enable this functionality.  The list below details what happens when this feature is enabled.
    <br></br>
    In a future release, this feature defaults to an enabled state.  We recommend any current users of Beyond Identity to turn on the feature with an administrator and to attempt an authentication as normal. With this feature enabled and authentication working as expected, no future change is required on your configuration.
