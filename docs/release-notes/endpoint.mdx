## Secure Access Release Notes

Secure Access release notes are published biweekly for commercial deployments in both the US and EU. FedRAMP and government environments receive updates two weeks after features are released to commercial deployments.

  <summary><p>Secure Access Release Notes</p></summary>
  
    Here’s a summary of the latest features and improvements to the Beyond Identity Secure Access platform.

    <br/>

## What's New
<br/>


### New Directory UI Features (**Early Access**)
We're introducing exciting new features in the **Directory** section of the platform. These features are currently in **Early Access**. If you'd like to try them out, contact Support.

<br/>

  - #### New Enrollment Summary Section
    A new **Enrollment Summary** now appears at the top of the **Identities** section, offering a quick snapshot of your directory. It displays key metrics such as the total number of identities, those enrolled or not enrolled, pending and failed invite attempts, and more.

      ![ReleaseNotes](../images/new-identities-summary.png)
<br/>

  - #### Batch Enrollment Feature
    Administrators can now onboard multiple users with a new **bulk enrollment** feature. This update simplifies enrollments by enabling administrators to send up to **200 invitation emails** at a time to multiple users.

    [View user documentation](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/directory/manage-users/add-users#enrolling-multiple-identities-bulk-enrollment)

<br/>

  - #### Batch Identities Deletion Feature
    Administrators can now delete multiple identities at once with a new **bulk deletion** feature.

<br/>

#### Multi-Realm Management Now Available (**Early Access**)
The new multi-realm feature allows administrators to manage Secure Work and Secure Customer identity directories within a single tenant, making it seamless to handle both employee and customer authentication workflows.

    View user documentation:  
    - [Secure Work Realms](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/directory/realms/)  
    - [Secure Customer Realms](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/directory/realms/customer-realms)

<br/>

#### Granular Role Permission Customization (**Early Access**)
    
  Administrators can now create and assign custom roles with granular, least-privilege permissions in the Secure Access Console. Admins can define exactly which actions each role can perform, such as allowing help desk staff to reset credentials or enabling application owners to manage app assignments. This feature minimizes the number of high-privilege accounts, reduces the attack surface, insider risk, and helps meet access control requirements for standards like SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and FedRAMP.

## Bug Fixes

- #### Eliminated Duplicate `USER_AUTHENTICATION` Events on Timeout
  Timeout scenarios no longer trigger multiple `USER_AUTHENTICATION` events. Events are now reliably emitted once per authentication attempt, improving log accuracy.

<br/>

- #### Corrected Invalid `UNAUTHORIZED` Authentication Events
  Resolved an issue where failed authentications could produce empty or invalid `USER_AUTHENTICATION - UNAUTHORIZED` events. These events now consistently contain the correct information for auditing and troubleshooting.

<br/>

- #### Firefox Private Browsing Login Issue
  Resolved an issue preventing logins in Firefox Private Browsing mode after configuring Okta as an identity provider (IdP). Authentication payload handling has been improved to ensure reliable login experiences.

  <summary><p>Version 2.104.0-4 BI Authenticator Release Notes</p></summary>


<p>Beyond Identity began deploying its Platform Authenticator v2.104.0-4 on June 27, 2025. This release includes one new feature and a bug fix.</p>

  <br/>

  <h4>What's New</h4>

| **Operating System** | **Feature**                         |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Windows, macOS       | Customizable Authentication Prompts |

IT administrators can now customize the informational text displayed during authentication/verification prompts on Windows and macOS desktop devices. This enhancement gives organizations the flexibility to deliver clear, context-specific guidance during the authentication process. Administrators can use the BIConfigure tool to set, retrieve, or clear this custom text, helping align prompts with internal policies, minimize user confusion, and support compliance initiatives.

  ## What's New

  ### Inactivity Timeout for Enhanced Security

  To help keep your data secure, the Secure Access Console now automatically logs users out after 15 minutes of inactivity. If your session times out, simply log in again to continue where you left off.

  ### Kandji + Beyond Identity Integration

  The Beyond Identity Mac Platform Authenticator (PA) is now integrated into Kandji's Auto App Collections, enabling fully automated deployment and updates via the Kandji MDM platform. This eliminates the need for IT admins to manually download and re-upload the latest version of the Mac PA, streamlining operations with zero-touch updates. By selecting options like "Continuously Enforce" and "Automatically enforce new updates," you can ensure your macOS devices will always have the latest, most secure version of the Beyond Identity Authenticator.

After completing authentication, users are now guided back to the previous screen more seamlessly, reducing friction and improving overall usability. This enhancement is part of our ongoing effort to deliver a more polished and user-friendly experience on key mobile platforms.

  <summary><p>Windows Version 2.102.0-6 and macOS 2.102.0-7 BI Authenticator Release Notes</p></summary>
  <p><ul>
  <h4>New</h4>
    <b>Platform Authenticator Proxy</b>
    <br></br>
    Beyond Identity is in the process of adding official proxy support to the Platform Authenticator on the macOS and Windows platforms. This is the first release to preview this functionality.
    <br></br>
    To minimize the chance of any change in behavior for existing users of Beyond Identity, this feature is not active by default. However, during the preview phase of this feature, the end user of the Platform Authenticator can enable this functionality.  The list below details what happens when this feature is enabled.
    <br></br>
    In a future release, this feature defaults to an enabled state.  We recommend any current users of Beyond Identity to turn on the feature with an administrator and to attempt an authentication as normal. With this feature enabled and authentication working as expected, no future change is required on your configuration.
