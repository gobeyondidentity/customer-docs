### February 6th, 2025

<details>
  <summary><p>Windows Version 2.102.0-6 and macOS 2.102.0-7 Endpoint Release Notes</p></summary>
  <p><ul>
  <h4>New</h4>
    <b>Platform Authenticator Proxy</b>
    <br></br>
    Beyond Identity is in the process of adding official proxy support to the Platform Authenticator on the macOS and Windows platforms. This is the first release to preview this functionality.
    <br></br>
    To minimize the chance of any change in behavior for existing users of Beyond Identity, this feature is not active by default. However, during the preview phase of this feature, the end user of the Platform Authenticator can enable this functionality.  The list below details what happens when this feature is enabled.
    <br></br>
    In a future release, this feature defaults to an enabled state.  We recommend any current users of Beyond Identity to turn on the feature with an administrator and to attempt an authentication as normal. With this feature enabled and authentication working as expected, no future change is required on your configuration.
