## Secure Access Release Notes

Secure Access release notes are published biweekly for commercial deployments in both the US and EU. FedRAMP and government environments receive updates two weeks after features are released to commercial deployments.


### October 25, 2025

<details>
  <summary><p>Secure Access Release Notes</p></summary>

Beyond Identity began deployment of a new **Secure Access** software release on October 25, 2025. 


<br/>

### What's New

- **Granular Roaming Authentication Configuration**
  Secure Access now supports granular configuration for roaming authentication. Administrators can define allowed **source IP addresses**, **users**, and **user groups** in addition to existing realm-level enablement. This enhancement offers finer control over authentication behavior for roaming users. For documentation, [click here](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/authentication-experience/roaming-authentication/roaming-authentication-config).
  <br/>

     ![Release-notes](../images/roaming-auth.png)

<br/>
- **Tenant Selection Prompt in Secure Access Console**
  When logging into the Secure Access console, users are now prompted to select a tenant if the tenant name they enter matches more than one tenant. This enhancement helps ensure users are directed to the correct tenant when duplicates exist.
  <br/>

     ![Release-notes](../images/multiple-tenants.png)

<br/>

- **Support for TPM Policy Rules (AAL3 Compliance)**
To meet the Authenticator Assurance Level 3 (AAL3) requirements defined by NIST, Secure Access now supports authoring Windows and Linux TPM policy rules. This enhancement enables administrators to build policies that verify Trusted Platform Module (TPM) attestation as part of authentication requirements.

<br/>



### Enhancements

- **Configurable Launch Mechanisms at Realm Level**  
  Secure Access now allows configuration of launch mechanisms, such as enabling or disabling **authentication URL copy-paste** and other app behaviors, at the **realm level**. This enhancement gives administrators greater control and parity with the existing tenant-level configuration options in Secure Work. This feature is primarily an **API-first experience**. Default launch mechanism settings are automatically created for each tenant or realm, but administrators can update these configurations through the API.  

  When this mechanism is configured — for example, enabling the **copy** flow type — end-users will see an **authentication URL copy-paste box** (as shown in the authentication link prompt) when verifying their identity via the Beyond Identity Authenticator.  

  **Note:** Copy functionality is **disabled by default** for all tenants, as it is considered a less secure option.


    ![Release-notes](../images/copy-paste-url.png)


- **Updated CrowdStrike API for Device Posture Data**  
  Secure Access now uses an updated **CrowdStrike API** designed for improved stability and accuracy in device posture reporting. This enhancement increases the reliability of policy decisions that depend on device health signals.  

- **Restriction on Super Administrator Role Editing**  
  As part of the upcoming capability for tenants to create custom roles in Secure Access, the initial **Super Administrator** role is now managed exclusively by Beyond Identity and can no longer be edited by end users. This change prevents accidental modifications that could impact platform functionality or access.  

  For full documentation on creating roles, [click here](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/directory/role-management/create-roles).  
  


<br/>

### Bug Fixes

- **Improved Policy Event Logging**  
  Some previously missing details in policy event logs are now correctly populated. Policy Create, Update, and Delete events now display the actor in the event log. For certain system-initiated events (create and delete), the **Actor** field will display as *system* or *Beyond Identity*, depending on context. This improvement provides clearer visibility into which actions are performed automatically versus manually by administrators.  

- **Fixed Missing Platform Icons on Authenticator Downloads Page**  
  Resolved an issue where platform icons were not appearing on the **Platform Authenticator downloads** page. Icons now display correctly for all supported platforms.

  <summary><p>Secure Access Release Notes</p></summary>

## Hot Fix Release

| PLATFORM | TYPE | DESCRIPTION |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Secure Access | Enhancement | **Passkey Management Enhancements**<br /><br />We’ve improved the Passkeys view in the Secure Access admin console to provide better visibility and easier management for admins and support staff.<br /><br />**What Changed**<br />- Added new identifying details for each passkey, including:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;• Platform<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;• Version<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;• Device name<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;• Serial number<br />- Rearranged existing columns to improve information visibility and streamline support workflows.<br /><br />**Note**: The new columns will populate with data after the passkey is next used for authentication.<br /><br />**Why This Matters**<br />These enhancements address customer feedback that the previous passkey view lacked sufficient detail to distinguish between individual passkeys. By providing richer metadata, admins can now:<br />- More easily identify and manage passkeys during rollout and ongoing support.<br />- Troubleshoot authentication issues with greater clarity. |
| Secure Access | Enhancement | **Passkey Metadata Enhancements in Admin Console**<br /><br />We’ve improved the passkey management interface to give admins and support staff more detailed device information.<br /><br />**New Columns Added**:<br />- **Platform** (Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android)<br />- **Version** (OS or API level, depending on platform)<br />- **Device Name**<br />- **Serial Number**<br /><br />![Passkey Columns Screenshot](../images/passkey-populate.png)<br /><br />**Dynamic Updates**: These fields now populate after a user successfully authenticates with the Platform Authenticator. If a user later upgrades their OS, the **Version** column will update automatically on their next successful authentication.<br /><br />**Improved Troubleshooting and Support**: Provides better visibility into enrolled devices, streamlines support processes, and aligns with Secure Work’s metadata display.<br /><br />**Notes**:<br />- “Not supported” will appear if the platform does not expose a specific field or if configuration prevents data sharing (e.g., iOS/Android only provide serial numbers when MDM-managed).<br />- On Android, the **Version** column reflects the **API Level**, not the OS version.<br />- On Windows, the **Version** column is the internal version reported by Windows (e.g., `10.0.22000` = Windows 11). |

### September 17, 2025

<details>
  <summary><p>Version 2.107.1(2) BI Authenticator Release Notes</p></summary>

## Hot Fix Release

| Platform | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Android | **Android Login Service**<br /><br />On Android 15 and 16, an issue was resolved where the Login Service could crash after a timeout, typically following about six hours of inactivity. This behavior is newly required and enforced by Google. In accordance with the latest Android platform requirements, foreground services now require an end-user interaction with the application to be initiated. This update ensures compatibility and a stable user experience. It is recommended that users upgrade to v2.107.1.<br /><br />**Impact on End-Users:**<br />This change may affect authentication flows. In some scenarios, where the app previously launched automatically to detect and handle an authentication flow, end-users may now be required to manually launch the app to complete the process. |


<br/>

<br/>
</details>

### September 15, 2025

<details>
  <summary><p>Version 2.107.1 BI Authenticator Release Notes</p></summary>

## Hot Fix Release

| Platform | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Windows | Bug | **Windows Platform Authenticator Issue**<br /><br />Beyond Identity Platform Authenticator, version 2.107.0, released earlier this week, was rolled back on September 11 after an installation issue was identified. Version 2.107.1 includes the fix and is now being redeployed to all customers.<br /><br />**What Changed**<br />Resolved an issue affecting **User installs** during upgrades where:<br />• The Platform Authenticator would not automatically start during authentication or user login.<br />• Start Menu items could be missing.<br /><br />**Impact**<br />• Customers with User installs who experienced these issues during upgrades from older versions should see them resolved with v2.107.1.<br />• **System installs were not affected.**<br />• No action is required for customers who remained on the prior stable version. |
| macOS | Bug | **Alert Dismissal on macOS 26 Beta**<br />Resolved an issue where an alert displayed by the Platform Authenticator could not be dismissed. While macOS 26 is not yet generally available, we are proactively addressing this issue to ensure compatibility when the OS update is released.<br /><br />**Proxy Auto-Detection Behavior**<br />Fixed a case where, in certain scenarios, proxy auto-detection could cause unwanted behavior. The Platform Authenticator now correctly handles cases where the operating system reports an invalid URL for proxy settings. |
 

<br/>

### September 11, 2025

<details>
  <summary><p>BI Authenticator Release Notes</p></summary>

We identified an issue during the update installation process in version **2.107.0** of the Windows Platform Authenticator. The issue primarily affected customers who performed self-installs (per-user installs). Out of an abundance of caution and to ensure stability and continuity for all customers, we have rolled back the release.

<br/>
### What Changed
- Rolled back version **2.107.0** for all customers.

<br/>
### Impact
- **If you have already deployed version 2.107.0 and are experiencing no issues, there is no further action required at this time.**  
- Customers who performed self-installs may have temporarily experienced update issues following the **2.107.0** deployment.

<br/>
### Next Steps
- A corrected version will be redeployed once fixes are verified and tested.

### What's New

<div className="no-bold-table">

| PLATFORM | FEATURE DESCRIPTION |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Windows  | <strong>Desktop login with YubiKeys and Web SSO (Available only in Secure Work)</strong><br /><br />Beyond Identity now integrates with Microsoft Windows to allow secure, passwordless desktop login using YubiKeys, a hardware security key that protects against phishing attacks and other credential-based threats.<br /><br />For a list of approved YubiKeys and configuration steps, [click here](https://support.beyondidentity.com/hc/en-us/articles/32621659512343-How-to-Configure-and-Manage-YubiKey-User-Enrollment-for-Windows-Desktop-Login-2-0-End-User).<br /><br />Users can now leverage phishing-resistant PIV smartcard login to Windows and extend it to SSO and apps, enforcing that access only happens from compliant devices.<br /><br />Note: This feature is available with Beyond Identity Platform Authenticator version 2.107 or later. |


</div>

<br/>

### Enhancements

<div className="no-bold-table">

| PLATFORM        | ENHANCEMENT DESCRIPTION |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Windows         | **Reduced installer size**<br /><br />The Windows System installer has been optimized to use less disk space and download size. Duplicate .NET 8 libraries were consolidated, and installation now uses the smaller, on-demand WebView2 installer. This makes installation faster and more efficient while keeping all functionality intact. |
| Windows and macOS | **Auto Proxy enabled by default**<br /><br />The Auto Proxy feature is now enabled by default, simplifying setup for environments that use proxies. |

</div>


<br/>

### Bug Fixes

| PLATFORM        | BUG FIX DESCRIPTION |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| All Platforms   | **Credential re-import sync**<br /><br />Fixed an issue where re-importing the same credential did not properly sync with the cloud. Beyond Identity Authenticator now keeps credentials consistent across device and cloud. |
| Windows         | **High DPI icon fixes**<br /><br />Corrected an issue where TaskBar and TaskTray icons did not display properly on high-DPI monitors and laptops. Icons now scale correctly on high-resolution displays. |
| Windows         | **System installer stability**<br /><br />Improved reliability of Windows System installers, especially when deployed with MDM tools such as Intune or SCCM. The update prevents incorrect downgrades when only the fourth version digit differs, blocks conflicting installs from multiple channels, and resolves corruption issues caused by partial installs. |
| Windows         | **Proxy detection reliability**<br /><br />Fixed an issue where proxy detection on Windows could fail intermittently. Proxy settings are now detected and applied more consistently, ensuring stable network connections. |
| Android         | **Scrollable deny messages**<br /><br />Custom policy deny messages are now scrollable, making long messages easier to read without being cut off. |
| Android         | **Accessibility Service crash fix**<br /><br />Fixed an issue where WebViews (such as “View third-party licenses” in “About Beyond Identity”) could crash while running on Android 9.0+. WebView now assigns a unique data directory suffix per process, preventing these conflicts and runtime crashes. |
| Android         | **Login Service stability fix**<br /><br />Fixed an issue where Android’s Login Service could occasionally crash in the background on Android 12+. This was caused by a race condition (a timing conflict between the operating system and the service). Although the service recovered automatically, the OS still displayed a crash pop-up. |

## Hot Fix Release 

### Bug Fix

#### **Added support for handling extra characters in the `SAMLRequest` parameter during Service Provider (SP)-initiated flows.**  

The `SAMLRequest` parameter is the login request that a service provider (such as Cisco WebEx) sends to an identity provider during an SP-initiated SAML flow. Some WebEx configurations include non-base64 characters in this request. This enhancement ensures those requests are processed correctly, improving reliability for WebEx integrations.


<br/>

<br/>
</details>



### August 27, 2025

<details>
  <summary><p>Secure Access Release Notes</p></summary>


## What's New

#### Realm Management
Realms created in the Secure Access console for Secure Work and Secure Customer can now be edited or deleted.
<br/>

#### Shortened SAML URLs for Cisco Compatibility  

We’ve added a new option to generate shortened SAML URLs to support Cisco products that enforce a 128-character limit on entity IDs and URLs.
<br/>
      - Admins can now enable a toggle to generate shorter **SP-initiated URLs** and **Issuer URLs**.  
      - This resolves configuration issues when setting up SAML apps for **Cisco VPN** and **WebEx Admin Portal**.  
<br/>
With this improvement, you can configure SAML applications for Cisco firewalls and services without hitting the 128-character restriction.  



<br/>
## Bug Fixes

#### Authenticator Download Links (FedRamp)
- Fixed incorrect download links for the Beyond Identity Authenticator during Secure Access setup in government environments. This change is not needed for commercial environments.
<br/>
#### Policy Editor Action Icon
- Fixed a CSS issue where the Action icon was hidden for policy rules with long descriptions, preventing edits or copies.
<br/>
#### Integration Field Validation
- Added character limits for integration names and descriptions to improve security.
<br/>
#### Realm Updates Visibility
- Fixed an issue where realm updates (create, rename, delete) were not immediately reflected in the console. Changes now appear without requiring a page refresh. **Note**: Multi-realm support for Secure Work realms in Secure Access remains limited.
<br/>
#### OIDC Discovery Endpoint
- Corrected an issue where OIDC applications displayed the wrong discovery endpoint URL.
<br/>
#### Integration Input Validation
- Expanded client-side input validation on integration forms for a more consistent user experience.
<br/>
#### Event Log Noise Reduction
- Removed unnecessary "User Authentication – UNAUTHORIZED" events that contained no meaningful details, reducing noise in admin event logs.

## Hot Fix Release 

### Session Termination on Role Permission Changes

Secure Access console sessions are now automatically terminated if a user’s role permissions are downgraded or if the account is suspended. Actions that can trigger session termination include:  <br/>
<br/>
  - Removing a user, or a group the user belongs to, from a role  
  - Removing permission scopes from a role the user is assigned to directly or through a group  
  - Deleting a role the user is assigned to directly or through a group  <br/>
<br/>
When a session is terminated due to a role permission change, the console will redirect to the login screen with a message indicating that the logout was caused by updated role permissions. Users who have not been suspended can log back in immediately, and their new session will reflect the updated role permissions.

  <summary><p>Version 2.106.1-2 BI Authenticator Release Notes</p></summary>

Beyond Identity began deploying its Platform Authenticator **v2.106.1-2** on August 6, 2025. This release includes an enhancement.

## Enhancements

| OPERATING SYSTEM | DESCRIPTION |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| Windows | **Windows Platform Authenticator 2.106.1-2 Hot Fix Release**<br /><br />The 2.106.1-2 release of the Windows Platform Authenticator is identical to version 2.106.0 (originally released on July 30, 2025). We are issuing a new build because version 2.106.0 was removed from our website on August 5, 2025, after being incorrectly flagged as a false positive by Microsoft Defender.<br /><br />Since Microsoft Defender SmartScreen rule updates can take several hours to propagate, we chose to release a new build (2.106.1-2) rather than re-publish the flagged 2.106.0. |

<details>
  <summary><p>Version 2.106.0 BI Authenticator Release Notes</p></summary>
  
    Beyond Identity began deploying its Platform Authenticator v2.106.0 on July 30, 2025. This release includes enhancements and bug fixes.

    <br/>

<h3>Enhancements</h3>
<br/>


| Operating System | Feature |
|------------------|---------|
| Windows, macOS, Android, iOS | **Faster Onboarding for Users with Registration Codes**<br />We removed an extra step during onboarding for users registering a Secure Access and Secure Work credential. Previously, users with a 9-digit registration code were required to click an additional button to enter the code. This step has been eliminated to streamline the process. |
| Windows | **Updated Windows Desktop Login Process** - *Not available for Secure Access* <br />We’ve improved the fingerprint enrollment experience for Windows Desktop Login to better align with Windows Hello requirements. The updated flow now intelligently adapts based on your system setup. For example, whether Windows Hello is enabled, if a PIN has been created, or if a fingerprint reader is available. We’ve also made it easier to access the fingerprint enrollment option within your passkey settings.|

<br/>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<br/>

| Operating System | Fix |
|------------------|-----|
| **Windows** | **Authentication Hang at Startup Resolved**<br />We've fixed an issue that could cause the Windows Platform Authenticator to freeze if launched right after system startup. |
| **Windows** | **WebViewHelper Resource Usage Optimized**<br />We've resolved an issue where multiple instances of WebViewHelper could run at the same time, unnecessarily consuming system resources. The update improves system performance and stability during authentication. |
| **Windows** | **Authentication Stability Improved**<br />We addressed a rare timing issue that could cause authentication to fail when the same request was processed by multiple components. This fix improves reliability and reduces the chance of unexpected failures during authentication. |
| **Android, iOS** | **Roaming QR Code Scanning Fixed**<br />We've resolved an issue that was preventing the app from recognizing and responding to Roaming QR codes. You can now scan these QR codes directly within the app’s camera screen, and it will correctly open the browser to continue the authentication flow, making sign-ins smoother and more reliable. |
| **Android** | **Android App Crash Message**<br />Resolved a race condition that could cause the Login Service to crash in the background on Android 12+ devices. Although the service would recover automatically, the operating system reported it as a crash and displayed a pop-up notification to users. |
| **Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux** | **Redundant Passkeys**<br />Resolved an issue where re-importing the same credential on a device could result in multiple redundant passkeys appearing in the Admin Console. The system now deletes the duplicate from the cloud to ensure the number of credentials remains consistent between the device and the cloud. |

  <h4>Changes</h4>

- #### Authentication URL During Log In

  A new box displaying an authentication URL within the standard Secure Access login dialog has been removed. While the dialog window itself remains part of the normal login flow, the section removed allowed users to copy and paste the URL into their browser to complete authentication. However, we’ve temporarily removed this feature to ensure a more seamless and fully supported login experience.

  <summary><p>Secure Access Release Notes</p></summary>
  
    Here’s a summary of the latest features and improvements to the Beyond Identity Secure Access platform.

    <br/>

<h3>What's New</h3>
<br/>

- #### Secure Access Roaming Authentication (Early Access)

    End users can now authenticate securely on devices that don’t have their passkey installed. This is ideal for shared workstations, kiosks, or virtual desktops, and provides a fast, phishing-resistant way to log in when a primary device is unavailable, broken, or lost. [More details in our user documentation](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/authentication-experience/roaming-authentication).

---

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

- #### "Create Magic Link" Scope is Now Non-sensitive

  The `magic-links:create` scope is no longer classified as sensitive. For customers using the custom roles feature, this means you no longer need to include all scopes when assigning a role that includes this scope.

<br/>
- #### Documentation Link for Creating Identities

  The **Getting Started** link for creating identities now directs to the correct page in the documentation.

  <summary><p>Secure Access Release Notes</p></summary>
  
    Here’s a summary of the latest features and improvements to the Beyond Identity Secure Access platform.

    <br/>

<h3>What's New</h3>
<br/>


#### New Directory UI Features (**General Availability**)
We're introducing exciting new features in the **Directory** section of the platform. 

<br/>

  - #### New Enrollment Summary Section
    A new **Enrollment Summary** now appears at the top of the **Identities** section, offering a quick snapshot of your directory. It displays key metrics such as the total number of identities, those enrolled or not enrolled, pending and failed invite attempts, and more.

      ![ReleaseNotes](../images/new-identities-summary.png)
<br/>

  - #### Batch Enrollment Feature
    Administrators can now onboard multiple users with a new **bulk enrollment** feature. This update simplifies enrollments by enabling administrators to send up to **200 invitation emails** at a time to multiple users.

    [View user documentation](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/directory/manage-users/add-users#enrolling-multiple-identities-bulk-enrollment)

<br/>

  - #### Batch Identities Deletion Feature
    Administrators can now delete multiple identities at once with a new **bulk deletion** feature.

    [View user documentation](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/directory/manage-users/delete-users#deleting-multiple-identities-in-bulk)

<br/>

#### Multi-Realm Management Now Available (**Early Access**)
The new multi-realm feature allows administrators to manage Secure Work and Secure Customer identity directories within a single tenant, making it seamless to handle both employee and customer authentication workflows.

    View user documentation:  
    - [Secure Work Realms](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/directory/realms/)  
    - [Secure Customer Realms](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/directory/realms/customer-realms)

<br/>

#### Granular Role Permission Customization (**Early Access**)
    
  Administrators can now create and assign custom roles with granular, least-privilege permissions in the Secure Access Console. Admins can define exactly which actions each role can perform, such as allowing help desk staff to reset credentials or enabling application owners to manage app assignments. This feature minimizes the number of high-privilege accounts, reduces the attack surface, insider risk, and helps meet access control requirements for standards like SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and FedRAMP.

     [View user documentation](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/directory/roles#customize-role-permissions)

---

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

- <h4> Eliminated Duplicate `USER_AUTHENTICATION` Events on Timeout </h4>
  Timeout scenarios no longer trigger multiple `USER_AUTHENTICATION` events. Events are now reliably emitted once per authentication attempt, improving log accuracy.

<br/>

- #### Corrected Invalid `UNAUTHORIZED` Authentication Events
  Resolved an issue where failed authentications could produce empty or invalid `USER_AUTHENTICATION - UNAUTHORIZED` events. These events now consistently contain the correct information for auditing and troubleshooting.

<br/>

- #### Firefox Private Browsing Login Issue
  Resolved an issue preventing logins in Firefox Private Browsing mode after configuring Okta as an identity provider (IdP). Authentication payload handling has been improved to ensure reliable login experiences.

  <p><ul>
  <h4>New</h4>
    <b>Platform Authenticator Proxy</b>
    <br></br>
    Beyond Identity is in the process of adding official proxy support to the Platform Authenticator on the macOS and Windows platforms. This is the first release to preview this functionality.
    <br></br>
    To minimize the chance of any change in behavior for existing users of Beyond Identity, this feature is not active by default. However, during the preview phase of this feature, the end user of the Platform Authenticator can enable this functionality.  The list below details what happens when this feature is enabled.
    <br></br>
    In a future release, this feature defaults to an enabled state.  We recommend any current users of Beyond Identity to turn on the feature with an administrator and to attempt an authentication as normal. With this feature enabled and authentication working as expected, no future change is required on your configuration.
