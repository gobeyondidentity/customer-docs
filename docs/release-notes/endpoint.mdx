## Secure Access

Learn more about the latest updates to the Secure Access platform.

### March 31st, 2025

<summary><p>Secure Access Updates</p></summary>
### What's new

- Integration Events logs
  - We've added debug capabilities for Integration issues and improved event transparency and accountability in the Beyond Identity Console.
<br></br>

### Bug fixes

- Fixed the Datadog SIEM integration configuration screen not displaying a required API Key field input when attempting to add the instance without the value.
- Resolved an issue that happens when manually adding an Identity then deleting values in the Add identity pop up. That behavior returned a `400` error and also caused the remaining user information to persist when attempting to create another new identity.
- Fixed inaccurate data for the Integrations activity log of the event's date and time recorded when comparing date values from the table on the Log page to the Activity page.
- Revised the language in the Policy Rules section of OS Version configurations. The description now reflects that the OS version rule applies to the last five updates of the current version of the operating system instead of the last five updates of the major version. This means updates do not cross versions, so for example the `14.x` version is not within any updates of a `15.x` version.
- Resolved an iOS issue that created a duplicate prompt during biometric authentication on trusted devices.
- Fixed a bug with Policy involving rules with geolocation comparison for event attributes not matching to users within that geolocation during policy outcome simulation.
- Fixed an API issue when attempting to add an identity to a non-existent group displaying an internal error of `500` instead of a `404` Not Found.
- Improved initialization of the Swift SDK against multi-thread initialization and also fixed an issue during initialization related to an inability to prevent the passkey directory from being backed up.

<br></br>
**v1.56**
- Fixed a bug where Administrators and Users login to the Beyond Identity Console navigated users to the incorrect login screen if the `?tenant={TENANT_NAME}` query parameter was present in the URL
<br></br>
**v1.59**
- Added Groups as an optional attribute statement value source
  - When creating a new application with Generic SAML, the dropdown field for Beyond Identity Attribute Name now includes `Groups`. This functionality enables bulk assignment for Groups. Both the Beyond Identity Console and the API support this.<br></br>

<br></br>
### Bug fixes

- Improved dashboard performance
- Fixed an API token error with the Okta | Beyond Identity integration which prevented `byndRegistered` custom attribute in Okta from being updated successfully upon end user enrollment in Beyond Identity
- Fixed an issue with SCIM-created Groups not being visible in the Application Assignment page
- Resolved an issue with policy attributes evaluating to undefined in the policy activity log
- Improved CrowdStrike policy evaluation accuracy for temporary API return errors that prevented successful user logins
- Fixed a bug with policy activity log displaying the incorrect status of CrowdStrike Device Found attribute

  <h4>New</h4>
    <b>Platform Authenticator Proxy</b>
    <br></br>
    Beyond Identity is in the process of adding official proxy support to the Platform Authenticator on the macOS and Windows platforms. This is the first release to preview this functionality.
    <br></br>
    To minimize the chance of any change in behavior for existing users of Beyond Identity, this feature is not active by default. However, during the preview phase of this feature, the end user of the Platform Authenticator can enable this functionality.  The list below details what happens when this feature is enabled.
    <br></br>
    In a future release, this feature defaults to an enabled state.  We recommend any current users of Beyond Identity to turn on the feature with an administrator and to attempt an authentication as normal. With this feature enabled and authentication working as expected, no future change is required on your configuration.
