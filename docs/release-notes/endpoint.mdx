## Secure Access Release Notes

Secure Access release notes are published biweekly for commercial deployments in both the US and EU. FedRAMP and government environments receive updates two weeks after features are released to commercial deployments.


### August 6, 2025

<details>
  <summary><p>Version 2.106.1-2 BI Authenticator Release Notes</p></summary>

Beyond Identity began deploying its Platform Authenticator **v2.106.1-2** on August 6, 2025. This release includes an enhancement.

## Enhancements

| OPERATING SYSTEM | DESCRIPTION |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| Windows | **Windows Platform Authenticator 2.106.1-2 Hot Fix Release**<br /><br />The 2.106.1-2 release of the Windows Platform Authenticator is identical to version 2.106.0 (originally released on July 30, 2025). We are issuing a new build because version 2.106.0 was removed from our website on August 5, 2025, after being incorrectly flagged as a false positive by Microsoft Defender.<br /><br />Since Microsoft Defender SmartScreen rule updates can take several hours to propagate, we chose to release a new build (2.106.1-2) rather than re-publish the flagged 2.106.0. |

  <summary><p>Version 2.106.0 BI Authenticator Release Notes</p></summary>
  
    Beyond Identity began deploying its Platform Authenticator v2.106.0 on July 30, 2025. This release includes enhancements and bug fixes.

    <br/>

<h3>Enhancements</h3>
<br/>


| Operating System | Feature |
|------------------|---------|
| Windows, macOS, Android, iOS | **Faster Onboarding for Users with Registration Codes**<br />We removed an extra step during onboarding for users registering a Secure Access and Secure Work credential. Previously, users with a 9-digit registration code were required to click an additional button to enter the code. This step has been eliminated to streamline the process. |
| Windows | **Updated Windows Desktop Login Process** - *Not available for Secure Access* <br />We’ve improved the fingerprint enrollment experience for Windows Desktop Login to better align with Windows Hello requirements. The updated flow now intelligently adapts based on your system setup. For example, whether Windows Hello is enabled, if a PIN has been created, or if a fingerprint reader is available. We’ve also made it easier to access the fingerprint enrollment option within your passkey settings.|

<br/>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<br/>

| Operating System | Fix |
|------------------|-----|
| **Windows** | **Authentication Hang at Startup Resolved**<br />We've fixed an issue that could cause the Windows Platform Authenticator to freeze if launched right after system startup. |
| **Windows** | **WebViewHelper Resource Usage Optimized**<br />We've resolved an issue where multiple instances of WebViewHelper could run at the same time, unnecessarily consuming system resources. The update improves system performance and stability during authentication. |
| **Windows** | **Authentication Stability Improved**<br />We addressed a rare timing issue that could cause authentication to fail when the same request was processed by multiple components. This fix improves reliability and reduces the chance of unexpected failures during authentication. |
| **Android, iOS** | **Roaming QR Code Scanning Fixed**<br />We've resolved an issue that was preventing the app from recognizing and responding to Roaming QR codes. You can now scan these QR codes directly within the app’s camera screen, and it will correctly open the browser to continue the authentication flow, making sign-ins smoother and more reliable. |
| **Android** | **Android App Crash Message**<br />Resolved a race condition that could cause the Login Service to crash in the background on Android 12+ devices. Although the service would recover automatically, the operating system reported it as a crash and displayed a pop-up notification to users. |
| **Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux** | **Redundant Passkeys**<br />Resolved an issue where re-importing the same credential on a device could result in multiple redundant passkeys appearing in the Admin Console. The system now deletes the duplicate from the cloud to ensure the number of credentials remains consistent between the device and the cloud. |

  <h4>Changes</h4>

- #### Authentication URL During Log In

  A new box displaying an authentication URL within the standard Secure Access login dialog has been removed. While the dialog window itself remains part of the normal login flow, the section removed allowed users to copy and paste the URL into their browser to complete authentication. However, we’ve temporarily removed this feature to ensure a more seamless and fully supported login experience.

  <summary><p>Secure Access Release Notes</p></summary>
  
    Here’s a summary of the latest features and improvements to the Beyond Identity Secure Access platform.

    <br/>

<h3>What's New</h3>
<br/>

- #### Secure Access Roaming Authentication (Early Access)

    End users can now authenticate securely on devices that don’t have their passkey installed. This is ideal for shared workstations, kiosks, or virtual desktops, and provides a fast, phishing-resistant way to log in when a primary device is unavailable, broken, or lost. [More details in our user documentation](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/authentication-experience/roaming-authentication).

---

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

- #### "Create Magic Link" Scope is Now Non-sensitive

  The `magic-links:create` scope is no longer classified as sensitive. For customers using the custom roles feature, this means you no longer need to include all scopes when assigning a role that includes this scope.

<br/>
- #### Documentation Link for Creating Identities

  The **Getting Started** link for creating identities now directs to the correct page in the documentation.

  <summary><p>Secure Access Release Notes</p></summary>
  
    Here’s a summary of the latest features and improvements to the Beyond Identity Secure Access platform.

    <br/>

<h3>What's New</h3>
<br/>


#### New Directory UI Features (**Early Access**)
We're introducing exciting new features in the **Directory** section of the platform. These features are currently in **Early Access**. If you'd like to try them out, contact Support.

<br/>

  - #### New Enrollment Summary Section
    A new **Enrollment Summary** now appears at the top of the **Identities** section, offering a quick snapshot of your directory. It displays key metrics such as the total number of identities, those enrolled or not enrolled, pending and failed invite attempts, and more.

      ![ReleaseNotes](../images/new-identities-summary.png)
<br/>

  - #### Batch Enrollment Feature
    Administrators can now onboard multiple users with a new **bulk enrollment** feature. This update simplifies enrollments by enabling administrators to send up to **200 invitation emails** at a time to multiple users.

    [View user documentation](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/directory/manage-users/add-users#enrolling-multiple-identities-bulk-enrollment)

<br/>

  - #### Batch Identities Deletion Feature
    Administrators can now delete multiple identities at once with a new **bulk deletion** feature.

    [View user documentation](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/directory/manage-users/delete-users#deleting-multiple-identities-in-bulk)

<br/>

#### Multi-Realm Management Now Available (**Early Access**)
The new multi-realm feature allows administrators to manage Secure Work and Secure Customer identity directories within a single tenant, making it seamless to handle both employee and customer authentication workflows.

    View user documentation:  
    - [Secure Work Realms](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/directory/realms/)  
    - [Secure Customer Realms](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/directory/realms/customer-realms)

<br/>

#### Granular Role Permission Customization (**Early Access**)
    
  Administrators can now create and assign custom roles with granular, least-privilege permissions in the Secure Access Console. Admins can define exactly which actions each role can perform, such as allowing help desk staff to reset credentials or enabling application owners to manage app assignments. This feature minimizes the number of high-privilege accounts, reduces the attack surface, insider risk, and helps meet access control requirements for standards like SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and FedRAMP.

     [View user documentation](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/directory/roles#customize-role-permissions)

---

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

- <h4> Eliminated Duplicate `USER_AUTHENTICATION` Events on Timeout </h4>
  Timeout scenarios no longer trigger multiple `USER_AUTHENTICATION` events. Events are now reliably emitted once per authentication attempt, improving log accuracy.

<br/>

- #### Corrected Invalid `UNAUTHORIZED` Authentication Events
  Resolved an issue where failed authentications could produce empty or invalid `USER_AUTHENTICATION - UNAUTHORIZED` events. These events now consistently contain the correct information for auditing and troubleshooting.

<br/>

- #### Firefox Private Browsing Login Issue
  Resolved an issue preventing logins in Firefox Private Browsing mode after configuring Okta as an identity provider (IdP). Authentication payload handling has been improved to ensure reliable login experiences.

  <br/>

  <p><ul>
  <h4>New</h4>
    <b>Platform Authenticator Proxy</b>
    <br></br>
    Beyond Identity is in the process of adding official proxy support to the Platform Authenticator on the macOS and Windows platforms. This is the first release to preview this functionality.
    <br></br>
    To minimize the chance of any change in behavior for existing users of Beyond Identity, this feature is not active by default. However, during the preview phase of this feature, the end user of the Platform Authenticator can enable this functionality.  The list below details what happens when this feature is enabled.
    <br></br>
    In a future release, this feature defaults to an enabled state.  We recommend any current users of Beyond Identity to turn on the feature with an administrator and to attempt an authentication as normal. With this feature enabled and authentication working as expected, no future change is required on your configuration.
