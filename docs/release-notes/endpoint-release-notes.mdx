## Device360

Device360 empowers security experts and novices alike with deep visibility into common security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within your device inventory. Go beyond simple device posture configurations to identify risks on devices using a flexible library of managed threat hunting queries, or define your own to respond to emerging threats within the scope of your unique environment.

To start using Device360, see <ins>[Device360 Getting Started](/docs/device360)</ins>.

### Authenticator installation
**Device360 supports Windows and macOS currently.** Click <ins>[here](/docs/authenticator-set-up#install-for-device360)</ins> to view supported platforms and install the authenticator.


### Known issue
When deleting a device from the Device360 console, you must also remove the credential from the authenticator.
To manually delete a credential in the authenticator:
1. Open the Beyond Identity Authenticator UI on the device.
2. On the **Device Data Collection** menu, click **Stop Collecting** from the drop-down which will delete the credential.
