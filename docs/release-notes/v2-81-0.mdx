<h3>What's new</h3>

- **Tenant and User Name in Console**: Admin console users can now see their tenant ID and user name when logged into the admin console. Clicking on the user name will reveal their user ID and email.

- **Support for Custom URL as Support Contact Info**: We've added the ability to enter a support URL instead of an email. Tenant administrators can add a custom URL in the support customization screen.
