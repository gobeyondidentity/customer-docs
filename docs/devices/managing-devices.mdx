#Managing devices
On the Devices page, you can quickly analyze devices for misconfigurations for vulnerabilities, outdated OS versions, and you can also add or manage devices. In addition, if you downloaded and enrolled a device from the Install Authenticator page,

The Device table shows the status of devices that have a passkey enrolled in Device360. Note that this is a different passkey than the one used for the Beyond Identity console and passwordless authentication.
##Update the data collection interval
You can specify the interval for how often device attributes on this page will be collected from devices that are online.
1. Click **Devices** in the navigation pane.
2. Click **Edit** beside Data collected every x.
![Alt text]("../images/devices/Data collection.png")
3. Under **Frequency**, select how often you want Device360 to poll enrolled devices and return results that display in the Devices table.
4. Click **Save Changes**. 

##Device table
The Device table shows device details and vulnerabilities from polling the device based on the data collection setting or an Osquery executed from the Device Query page.
Click a row with a device to view details. 

###Device Name
A custom name you can set for the device when creating it using Add Device on this page.  

###Device ID
The Device ID is a value assigned by Beyond Identity and is useful to:
- See how many passkeys are on a device
- Ensure passkeys are sync’d between multiple devices
- Understand which passkeys will need to be revoked If a user losses a device

###Device Serial Number
The serial number associated with the device. 

###Host Name
The label assigned to the device on network. 

###Vulnerabilities
Displays any configuration or vulnerabilities found on the device, such as a firewall that isn't enabled so you can begin remediation. 
 
###OS Version
Displays the operating system version of the device. Use this column to locate devices that are on vulnerable operating systems. 

###Enrollment Status
Displays the status of the enrollment. Statuses are:
- Active - The device is online and available. 
- Pending - Occurs when:
-- The device was added recently, and initial queries associated with the table are running.

-- The enrollment code\passkey hasn’t been added to the authenticator. To enroll the device:
<ol>
<li> Click the Edit icon under the Actions column.
</li>
<li> Click **Generate new enrollment code** and copy the code. 
</li>
<li> Click **Save changes**. 
</li>
<li> Open the Beyond Identity authenticator.
</li>
<li> Click the + button to add the new enrollment code.
 ![Add enrollment code to authenticator]("../images/devices/Authenticator add passkey.png")
</li>
<li> Paste or type the enrollment code in the Enter 9-digit code screen. Note that a cursor doesn't appear on the screen. 
 ![Paste enrollment code into authenticator]("../images/devices/Add regenerated passkey.png")
</li>
<li> Return to the Devices page. The device should have a status of Active once queries used to update the table complete.    
</li>
   </ol>

###Last Data Collection
The last date and time that data was collected from either the data collection setting on this page or an Osquery executed from the Device Query page.

###Actions

Click the Edit icon under Actions to perform the following:

- Add or update the name that displays for the device.

- Generate a new enrollment code to bind or re-bind a device to Device360.

- Delete a device (useful when an employee leaves or a device is decommissioned).
