# Add a device

To begin collecting data and running queries on a device, you must first enroll it. 

:::note
- If you are new to Beyond Identity, you will need to install the authenticator and add Device360 enrollment code and to the authenticator (follow all steps below).
- If you are a Secure Workforce customer, Device360 uses the same authenticator that allows you to securely sign into corporate applications without passwords. You will just need to generate a Device360 enrollment code and and add it to your existing authenticator (start with step 5 below). This 
credential will not impact your Secure Workforce passkey in the authenticator.
:::

1. Click **Devices** under My Project Space.

2. Click **Add Device**.
