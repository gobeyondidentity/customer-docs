# Enroll a device

You can enroll or re-enroll a device in Device360 by generating a new enrollment code and adding it to the Beyond Identity authenticator. 

:::note 
If you are a Secure Workforce customer, this will not impact the passkey in the authenticator that allows you to securely sign into corporate applications without passwords.
:::

1. Click the Edit icon under the Actions column on the Devices page. 

   ![Edit icon]("../images/devices/edit-icon.png")

2. Click **Generate new enrollment code**.

 ![Edit Device dialog]("../images/devices/edit-device.png")

3. Copy the **Enrollment code**.

4. Click **Save changes**. 

5. Remove the current passkey from the authenticator:Â 

    a. Open the Beyond Identity authenticator and select the passkey for this tenant.

    b. Click **About this passkey**.
 
       ![Authenticator]("../images/devices/authenticator-about-passkey.png")

    c. Click **Remove passkey from computer**.

       ![Remove passkey]("../images/devices/authenticator-delete-passkey")

6. Add the regenerated enrollment code to bind your device to this tenant: 
 
    a. Click the + button to add the new enrollment code.

       ![Add passkey]("../images/devices/authenticator-add-passkey.png")

    b. Paste or type the enrollment code in the Enter 9-digit code screen. Note that a cursor doesn't appear on the screen. 
 
       ![Enrollment page]("../images/devices/authenticator-code.png")

       The device will be added to the Device table with a status of Pending until internal queries complete. Once those complete, the status will change to Active.
