You can rebind or re-enroll a device iby generating a new enrollment code and adding it to the Beyond Identity authenticator. 

:::note 
If you are a Secure Workforce customer, this will not impact the passkey in the authenticator that allows you to securely sign into corporate applications without passwords.

5. Remove the current passkey from the authenticator. For more information, see [Remove a passkey from a device](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/docs/remove-passkey).
   
6. Add the regenerated enrollment code to bind your device to this tenant:
