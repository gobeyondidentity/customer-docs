#Running device queries
Device360 live queries allow you to quickly and efficiently gather information from all devices in a tenant to support threat hunting, policy management and impact assessment, and asset inventory purposes. Device360 provides a number of pre-canned queries that help collect attributes that may not be accessible at the time of authentication (e.g., list running process, list installed software, list chrome extensions).

<ol>
<li>Click **Device Query** under My Project Space.
</li>
<li>Click the **Query Library** tab.
![Edit icon]("../images/devices/DQ-Library tab.png")
</li>
<li>Click a query card from the list to view details for it.
![List of query cards]("../images/devices/DQ-card details.png")
</li>
<li>Note the timeout for the query under **Run Query for 5 minutes**. This specifies the timeout value to account for latency, device lifecycles, etc. Queries should return results in less than 30 seconds based on the polling interval.
</li>
<li>(Optional) Select the drop-down beside **Run once now** if you want to schedule the query to run on a regular basis.
![Schedule run options]("../images/devices/DQ - card schedule runs.png")
</li>
<li>(Optional) Click **View Full Query** if you want to see more than the first three lines of the query that will run.
</li>
<li>Click **Run Now**. You will be returned to the Device Query page's Query tab to view the status of the query.

</li>
<li>Click the **Query Name** to view results. You don't have to wait for the query to complete to view the results. For more information, see "Viewing query results".
</li>
</ol>
