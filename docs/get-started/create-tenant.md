# Step 1. Create a tenant

A tenant provides a way to group users who share similar privileges. The process to create a tenant account for your workforce is currently performed by a Beyond Identity team member. Click [request a tenant](https://forms.gle/3BvBsthE8ga4ohSd7) to fill out the request form.

A Beyond Identity team member will contact you to set up your tenant account. During this process, you will be provided access to the [Admin Console](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/admin-console/admin-console-login) and the team member will help set up some basic settings.  A member or members of your organization will be assigned a role of "super admin" that allows them to perform all the functions the Admin Console offers.

During the setup process, you will be provided with the following settings:

*   Tenant Name
*   API Token
*   Admin Console URL

Once your account has been created with Beyond Identity, you can continue with your [Account Configuration](/docs/secure-work/getting-started/account-configuration).
