A tenant provides a way to group users who share similar privileges. 

The process of creating a tenant involves:

1. You complete the [request form](https://forms.gle/3BvBsthE8ga4ohSd7) to have your tenant created by Beyond Identity. 

2. Beyond Identity will contact you with:

   - Tenant name

   - API token

   - [Admin Console](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/admin-console/admin-console-login) URL
  
3. Beyond Identity will help you set up your tenant with basic settings.
