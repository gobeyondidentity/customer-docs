Beyond Identity's Secure Workforce safeguards company resources and closes data breach vectors by ensuring that only authorized users and devices have access to cloud resources. 

This is acheived by replacing passwords, the most common vector for data breaches and  ransomware attacks with strong multi-factor authentication that restricts access to only secure, registered devices.
