<!-- if we don’t have jamf support on ios, than any policy evaluation where the enrichment phase detects a jamf call and the inputs have a platform of of ios, we should fire a not supported event because we know for a fact that the policy rule will not match. While there is even more we can do here, adding visibility is low hanging fruit to take pain out of the debugging process for all parties. It is my perception that this would not be hard to build, interested in hearing thoughts. I’d like to see us prioritize this as the first new event for this project. -->
