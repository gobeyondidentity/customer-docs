# Install the authenticator and enroll devices
To begin collecting data and running queries on a device, you must first install the Beyond Identity authenticator on a device and enroll it. Select from the following installation options:

- <ins>[New customer installation and enrollment](#new-customer-installation-and-enrollment)</ins> 
- <ins>[Secure Workforce customer installation and enrollment](#secure-workforce-customer-installation-and-enrollment)</ins>

 
## New customer installation and enrollment 
If you are new to Beyond Identity, you will need to install 

1. Select **Inventory > Device Inventory** in the left nav bar. 

2. Click **Add Device**.

   Once the device is enrolled by entering the 9-digit code, it will be added to the Device table.
   
   You can now monitor and query the device.


## Secure Workforce customer installation and enrollment
If you are a Secure Workforce customer, Device360 uses the same authenticator that allows you to securely sign into corporate applications without passwords. You will just need to generate a Device360 enrollment code and and add it to your existing version 2.94 or later authenticator. This will not impact your Secure Workforce passkey in the authenticator.
:::note 
For Secure Workforce customers, Beyond Identity's Windows Desktop Login is not compatible with Device360.
