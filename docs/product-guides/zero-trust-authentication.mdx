## What is Zero Trust Authentication in Beyond Identity?

Beyond Identity developed a Zero Trust Authentication tool that provides secure access for all employees and contractors.

- **Phishing-resistant MFA:** Authenticate both the user and their device with only phishing-resistant factors and credential operations with device-bound passkeys and ZERO reliance on humans in the authentication loop.

- **Single-device, passwordless UX:** Single-device, passwordless login experiences that takes out the speedbumps in authentication across every device and OS (including Linux!)

- **Continuous authentication:** ‍Re-evaluates user, device, and third-party risk signals every 10 minutes and enforces risk-based policy against these ongoing evaluations even during active sessions. Combined with the ability to set policies on a per-application basis, a new capability introduced with our SSO, you can easily leverage continuous authentication for high risk applications.

- **Fine-grained device trust:** Protect sensitive apps by defining fine-grained, adaptive risk-based policies on a per application basis.

Available features may vary based on the package selected.


## Quickstart checklist

Review the following steps for the fastest way to get started using Zero Trust Authentication.

1. [Integrate Beyond Identity as an identity provider (IdP).](/docs/access-control/identity-providers/identity-providers)

2. [Configure integrations.](/docs/tools/integrations)

3. [Add policy rules](/docs/policy/rules) to allow or deny authentications. 

4. (Optional) [Configure branding](/docs/tools/branding) to match your corporate look-and-feel for the email that will be sent to users to enroll their devices.

5. Add users to the Beyond Identity platform.

   - [Manually add users.](/docs/directory/manage-users/add-users)

   - [Add directory integrations (SCIM).](/docs/access-control/applications/generic-scim)

   Once you've added users, you can add a Passkey. This will send an email to the user to enroll their device.

   :::note
   You may want to add a group and assign the users first, and then return to the **Manage Users > Add Users** page to add a passkey.

6. [Add groups and assign users to those groups.](/docs/directory/groups)

7. Review events.
