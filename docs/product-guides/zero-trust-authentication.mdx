## What does the next generation of Secure Workforce do?

The next generation of our Secure Workforce platform provides a simple, intuitive interface for passwordless identity access management. The platform is designed to help companies implement passkey authentication to their applications and secure access for all employees and contractors.

## Quickstart checklist

Review the following steps for the fastest way to get started using Secure Workforce.

1. [Integrate Beyond Identity as an identity provider (IdP).](/docs/auth-and-sso/product-integration-guides)

2. [Configure branding](/docs/deployment/branding) to match your corporate look-and-feel for the email that will be sent to users when you add identities.

3. Add users (identities) to the Beyond Identity platform.

   - [Manually add users.](/docs/directory/identities)

   - [Add directory integrations (SCIM).](/docs/directory/directory-integrations)

4. [Add groups and assign users to those groups.](/docs/directory/groups)
