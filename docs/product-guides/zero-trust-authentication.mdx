## What is Zero Trust Authentication in Beyond Identity?

Beyond Identity provides a Zero Trust Authentication tool that provides secure access for all employees and contractors.

- **Phishing-resistant MFA:** Authenticate both the user and their device with only phishing-resistant factors and credential operations with device-bound passkeys and ZERO reliance on humans in the authentication loop.
- **Single-device, passwordless UX:** Single-device, passwordless login experiences that takes out the speedbumps in authentication across every device and OS (including Linux!)
- **Continuous authentication:** ‚ÄçRe-evaluates user, device, and third-party risk signals every 10 minutes and enforces risk-based policy against these ongoing evaluations even during active sessions. Combined with the ability to set policies on a per-application basis, a new capability introduced with our SSO, you can easily leverage continuous authentication for high risk applications.
- **Fine-grained device trust:** Protect sensitive apps by defining fine-grained, adaptive risk-based policies on a per application basis.

Available features may vary based on the package selected.


## Quickstart checklist

Review the following steps for the fastest way to get started using Zero Trust Authentication.

1. Integrate Beyond Identity as an identity provider (IdP).

2. [Configure integrations, if available.](/docs/platform/integrations)

3. [Add policy rules](/docs/policy/rules) to allow or deny authentications. 

4. (Optional) [Configure branding](/docs/customizations/branding) to match your corporate look-and-feel for the email that will be sent to users to enroll their devices.

5. Add users (identities) to the Beyond Identity platform.

   - [Manually add users.](/docs/directory/identities)

   - [Add directory integrations (SCIM).](/docs/directory/directory-integrations)

   Once you've added users, you can add a Passkey. This will send an email to the user to enroll their device.

   :::note
   You may want to add a group and assign the users first, and then return to the Identities page to add a passkey.

6. [Add groups and assign users to those groups.](/docs/directory/groups)

7. Review events.
