Users can be added to one or more groups. To add a user to a group:

1.  Log into the Admin console and from the Home screen, select the **Groups** tab.
2.  The Groups page displays the list of groups currently in your tenant. 
3.  Locate and then click on the desired group. For example, **Require** **Intune on Windows**.

4.  The group details are displayed. If any users have been previously added to the group, they are listed under the **Members** section. Click **Add Users**.
