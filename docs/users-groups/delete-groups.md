Deleting Groups
===============

To delete a group that is no longer needed:

1.  Log into the [Admin console](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/admin-console/admin-console-login) and from the Home screen, select the **Groups** tab.
2.  The Groups page displays the list of groups currently in your tenant. Locate and select the group listed on the Groups page.
