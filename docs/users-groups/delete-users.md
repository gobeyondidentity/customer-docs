When a user is deleted from your tenant, they longer have access to and cannot authenticate to your apps using Beyond Identity. To delete a user:

1.  Select **Users** from the left menu of the [Admin Console](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/admin-console/admin-console-login).
2.  From the Users page, search for the user. Use the **Search** field to easily find the user based on the **name**, **email**, or **ID**.

3.  Once the user is located and selected, click **Delete User**.

4.  A dialog is displayed asking if you want to delete the user. Click **Delete**.

5.  The dialog closes and the user is no longer listed on the Users page.
