Groups are used to manage the authentication and device adds for users with similar characteristics. All users within a group are bound by the polices for the group. For example, a policy has been defined for a group named "Require Intune for Windows" that requires users within that group to have integrated with Microsoft Intune in order to successfully to authenticate. If not, they are denied. Any number of groups can be created.
