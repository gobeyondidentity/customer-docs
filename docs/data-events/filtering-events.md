Events can be filtered by selecting one or more items from any of the drop-down menus at the tops of the page. Only those events matching the selected events will be displayed on the page. Events can be filtered on:

- Date Range
    
- Event type
    
- Event outcome
    
- Event service
    
- Specific policy version
    

### Filter on a Date Range
