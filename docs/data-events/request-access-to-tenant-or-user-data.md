You can create a Data Access Request from Beyond Identity if the data log isn't available through the Admin Console or if you need a more significant subset of data not provided through an API. 

The Beyond Identity data team will process the data export. Once the data export is complete, the support team will confirm the request has been processed and provide the content. This process will take five business days.


1. From the Customer Support Portal, open a [Data Access Request](https://support.beyondidentity.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=6747444827927).

2. Send a Data Access Request to support@beyondidentity.com  

   [Why are we submitting a form and then sending the same information via email to support?  This makes no sense because this is double..]

   **Your email address:** Provide your address

   **Subject:** Request Access for `<TENANT_ID or USER_ID>` Data  

   **Message:** Provide a brief description and justification

3. Respond to the confirmation request that Beyond Identity sends. The confirmation request is sent to the individual associated with the account. Without a response, Beyond Identity can't proceed.
