## General Settings

### Logo

- **URL**: Provide a URL to your custom logo. If no URL is provided, the default Beyond Identity logo will be used. For optimal display and compatibility, we recommend that the logo be square-shaped. There is no strict size limit, but for best results and faster loading times, aim for a logo size within the range of 200x200 to 500x500 pixels.
