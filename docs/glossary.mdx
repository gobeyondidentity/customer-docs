## Policy

A policy is a collection of rules that determine how to treat any given transaction managed by the Beyond Identity Cloud. A policy describes which transactions it governs and the action states how to handle the matching transactions.

Each registration (credential binding) and authentication operation looks at the specific policy for an Allow, Monitor, or Deny decision before completion. A Deny decision results in rejection of the operation.
