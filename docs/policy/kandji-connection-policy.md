You can write policy to allow, monitor, or deny access based on the connection setting configured for a device. In the following example, Kandji-connected devices are allowed to authenticate and add devices.

1.  From the **Add Rule** dialog, click **Add attribute** to the right of the **integration** attribute.
2.  Select the following from the drop-down menus:
    1.  `Kandji`
    2.  `Connection is`
    3.  `Available`
3.  Leave the `Allow` setting.
4.  Click **Add**.
