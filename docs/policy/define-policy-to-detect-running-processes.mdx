>This functionality is currently available on macOS, Windows, and Linux platforms.

You can write policy to detect and restrict access to a device that does not have a required process running (for example, BitLocker) and write an appropriate deny message.

You can write policy to detect processes running on a device and make decisions to allow or restrict access to a device based on the defined policy rule. For example, a policy rule can be written to restrict access if the device does not have a required process running (for example, BitLocker) and write an appropriate deny message.

1. From the [Admin Console](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/admin-console/admin-console-login), select the **Policy** tab.

2. From the [Policy page](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/policy/policy-writing/writing-policy#creating-rules), click **Edit Policy**.

3. From the **Add Rule** dialog, click **Add Attribute** next to **device platform**.

4. Select the appropriate platform from the drop-down menu.

5. Click the second **Add attribute button** and select either `Process Running contains` or `Process Running does not contain` from the drop-down menu.

6. Type the appropriate value to the right of the attribute that you just selected.

7. Set any other applicable attributes.

8. Under **Then**, select the appropriate permissions action (`Allow`, `Deny`, or `Monitor`) from the drop-down menu.

9. Click **Add**.
