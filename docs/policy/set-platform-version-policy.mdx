Policy can be written to detect a specific version or version range that must be met to allow or restrict a device to authenticate or a device to be added. If a device attempting to authenticate or making a request to be added does not match the version needed to authenticate, permission is not granted. If matched, authentication is granted.

To write policy based on platform version:

1. From the [Admin Console](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/admin-console/admin-console-login), select the **Policy** tab.

2. From the [Policy page](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/policy/policy-writing/writing-policy#creating-rules), click **Edit Policy**. 

3. From the **Add Rule** dialog, click **Add attribute** next to **device platform** and select the appropriate platform from the drop-down menu.

4. Click the second **Add attribute** button that appears. By default, the `**Antivirus**` attribute is displayed in the first field.

5. Click the drop-down menu and select the `Version` attribute.

6. Select the appropriate operator from the drop-down menu in the second field and then type in a version or versions in the third field. Keep the following points in mind when specifiying operators and version numbers:

    1. The following operators are supported: `is`, `greater than`, `greater than or equal to`, `less than`, `less than or equal to`

    2. A wildcard (`*****`) can be used when specifying a single version using the `is` operator. (For example, `11.0.` or `10.`)

    3. When using the above operators, specify using the `_#.#.#_` format, which indicates the `major version`, `minor version`, and `build number` of the platform. For example, `10.0.19042` corresponds to Windows 10 (major), 0. (minor) and 19042 (build).

    4. When specifying more than one version, use a comma-separated list with no spaces. For example, 10.1.0,10.1.2 or 10.1.1,10.1.2,10.2.

7. Set any other applicable attributes.

8. Under **Then**, select the appropriate permissions action (`Allow`, `Deny`, or `Monitor`) from the drop-down menu.

9. Click **Add** when done.

10. The rule is added to the **Edit Policy** page. Create additional rules as needed or click [Publish Rule](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/policy/policy-publish-rules/publishing-rules) to permanently save it.
