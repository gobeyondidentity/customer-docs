<!-- this is NOT a standalone topic because it's part of the "policy creation" process -->

For a rule to be permanently saved, it must be published. Rules can be published individually or in groups. Once rules are published they are saved when you exit the Admin Console.

To publish a rule, click **Publish changes** located in the upper-right corner of the **Edit Policy** page.

The rules list is updated with the latest set of rules.

In addition to the current set of rules, you can view a list of all previously saved sets of rules, and restore one as the current set. See [Viewing and Restoring Previous Policy Rules](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/policy/policy-viewing/viewing-and-restoring-previous-policy-rules).
