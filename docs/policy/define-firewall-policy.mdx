You can write policy to check whether or not a firewall is installed on a device that is attempting to authenticate or requesting permission to be added and write the appropriate rule allowing or denying the device.  To write a firewall policy:

1. From the [Admin Console](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/admin-console/admin-console-login), select the **Policy** tab.

2. From the [Policy page](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/policy/policy-writing/writing-policy#creating-rules), click **Edit Policy**. 

3. From the **Add Rule** dialog, click **Add attribute** next to **device platform** and select the appropriate platform from the drop-down menu.

4. Click the second **Add attribute** button that appears. By default, the `Antivirus` attribute is displayed in the field.

5. Click the drop-down menu to select the `Firewall` attribute.

6. Select the appropriate attribute from the second drop-down menu.

7. Set any other applicable attributes.

8. Under **Then**, select the appropriate permissions action (`Allow`, `Deny`, or `Monitor`) from the drop-down menu.

9. Click **Add**.

10. The rule is added to the **Edit Policy** page. Create additional rules as needed or click [Publish Rule](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/policy/policy-publish-rules/publishing-rules) to permanently save it.
