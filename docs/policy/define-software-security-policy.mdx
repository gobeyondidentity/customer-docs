You can write policy to detect whether or not security software such as CrowdSrike or Jamf is running on a device when attempting to authenticate and/or requesting permission to be added and write the appropriate rule allowing or denying the device.  To write a security software policy:

1.  From the [Admin Console](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/admin-console/admin-console-login), select the **Policy** tab.
2.  From the [Policy page](/docs/secure-work/workforce-settings/policy/policy-writing/writing-policy#creating-rules), click **Edit Policy**.
3.  From the **Add Rule** dialog, click **Add attribute** next to **device platform** and select the appropriate platform from the drop-down menu.

4.  Click the second **Add attribute** button that appears. By default, the `Antivirus` attribute is displayed in the field.
5.  Click the drop-down menu to select the `Installed Security Software` attribute.
6.  Select the appropriate attribute from the second drop-down menu.
7.  Set any other applicable attributes.
8.  Under **Then**, select the appropriate permissions action (`Allow`, `Deny`, or `Monitor`) from the drop-down menu.
9.  Click **Add**.
