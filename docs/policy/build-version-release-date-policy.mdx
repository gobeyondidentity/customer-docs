<SupportedOsAuthenticatorWindowsOnly />

System administrators can write policy to allow or restrict macOS and Windows users to authenticate and/or add devices based on the build/version and release date attribute settings. If set, the policy engine checks to see if the:

*	Build (macOS) or Revision (Windows) is within the last n update of the most recent major release.
	
*	Build Release Date (macOS) or Revision Release Date (Windows) is within or is not within the last number of specified days.
